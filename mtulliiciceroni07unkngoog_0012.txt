1. ,Τιιιι De Officiis is one of a series of works in which
Cicero attempted to treat nearly all the questions which in
his time were comprehended m a system of philosophy. In
the Hortensius, a dialogus no longer extant, he sought to
commend the study to his countrymeu3 in the Academica
he treated of the criterion of truth, and gave a history of the
Academic sch0013 in the De Finibus, which should be read
in connection with the present work, he presented the doe-
trines of the various schools in regard to the summum bonum,
or. the'highest'good3 in the De Natura Deorum ⁴he treated
in⁴ a similarmanner the question of the existence and attri-
butes of the Deity, aud bis relation to man3 in the Tuscu-
lanae ,Disputationes he discussed ‚certain practical questions
in the domain of ethics, · and finally, after a few less impor-
tant workS, he wrote the De offici-ix, which is devoted to the
paraenetic or advisory part of morale».

2. Cicero first makes mention of being occupied with this .
work in a letter to Atticus dated in June, nnc 44 (Ep. ad
Att. XV. 13, 6)· , but a journey to Greece,¹ begun though not
finished during the summer, and a return to political life in
the autumn, hindered very much its completion. We learn
from another letter to Atticus (XVI. 11, 4) that the first two
books were already written in November, and that the third
was begun3 so that the-whole was probably brought to an
end before the expiration of the year.

3. From the letter ,last quoted we may infer that Atticus
had criticised the use of the plural number in the title De

¹De Off. 111. 33, 121.
