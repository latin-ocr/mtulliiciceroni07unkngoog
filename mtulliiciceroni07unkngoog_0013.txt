Officiis ,³ and Cicero thought it necessary to explain the
usage. The corresponding expression in Greek was περὶ τοῦ
καθήκοντος, and the singular Dc Officio seemed to Atticus the
natural translation. Cicero answers that De Officiis is more
complete (sed inscriptio plenior de officiis) 3 and in another let-
