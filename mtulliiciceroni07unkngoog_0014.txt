have been interested in it, even when most occupied in politi· ἱ
cal life.¹ When he was a young man, the stndy of Greek
philosophy was already very common at Rome, and ample
means were at his command for becoming acquainted with
the various schools then in vogue. He studied the Epicurean
system under Phaedrus32 the New Academy under Philo of
Larissa3⁸ from DiodotuS, who lived for some time in his
house, he learned the doctrines of the Stoic school; and a
journey to Greece gave him an opportunity of hearing Zeno,
the Epicurean,‘ Antiochus, the founder of the Academic
Eclecticism, and especially Posidonius at Rhodes.

7. Philosophy was nevertheless with him only a means of
’ discipline or a recreation3 and after his return to Rome other
, occupations must have prevented any systematic attention to
it. The character of Cicero’s mind, too, was practical and
better adapted to the advocate than the philosopher.⁸ The
same thing may be said of his style of writing; it is too
rhetorical for the rigor of philosophie discussion. Another
hinderance, and a very serious one, arose from the fact that
the Latin language had never before been employed in such
writingS, and afforded no equivalents for many of the subt-ile
technical expressions of the Greek.⁸ One must not there·
fore expect from him an original system or scientific precis-
ion of statement; he wrote for occupatiori and diversion3⁷
and he himself claims only the merit of presenting to his ·
countrymen the philosophy of the Greeks in a popular and
atti-active form, and of creating a new voeabulary for the pur·
pose.' His philosophical works were nearly all composed
during the last three years of his life, when he had retired in
discouragement from public affairs, and was much broken in
spirit by domestic afflietion.⁰ In this short time he wrote
