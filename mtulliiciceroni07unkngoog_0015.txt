an amount which seems to us almost incredible, impossible
indeed, had he relied wholly on his own resources; but his
habit was to choose a work of some Greek philosopher, and
to translate it or give the substance in his own words, adding
any illustrations that occurred to him from Roman life.²

8. His reading, no doubt very extensive, had shown him
the great divergence of opinion among philosophers upon all
the subjects that came under their consideration3' and this
fact alone sufficed to convince him that it was impossible to
arrive at any certainty in these matters. He therefore pro-
fessed himself an adherent of the New Academy,⁸ which pro-
claimed this impossibility as a fundamental tenet. But this
systematic doubt of everything did not satisfy him3 the'ac·
knowledgment that anything like absolute certainty was un-
attainable became for 'him a starting-point for a study of the
probable. Although certainty was impossible, he held that
investigation might lead to a high degree of probability,
enough for all the practical purposes of life.⁴ He held him*-
self therefore at liberty to choose from any system a doctrine
which seemed to have the balance of probability in its favor,
and to change, this at any time for another which then ap-
peared more probable.⁸ “

9. One point was always clear to him, that all philosophy
has a value chiefly as a guide for practical life! This was
natural for a man of the world and for a Roman. He com-
mended Socrates ⁷ for turning philosophical speculation from
useless search after the origin of things to the study of the
problems of ordinary life. DialecticS, metaphysicS, and phys-
ics had for him very little importance, the latter mainly as a
means of finding out something of the existence and manner
of life of the Deity, and his relations to mankind. The real
