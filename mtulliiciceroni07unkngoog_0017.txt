is given, derived from Stoic sources; and, as frequent allusion
is made to the doctrines of this school, it may not be amiss to
cast a rapid glauce at them, so far as is necessary in order to
understand the book.

12. The study of morals, in the Stoic and in all other sys-
tems of philosophy since the time of Socrates, began with an
inquiry into the idea of the highest good, the τέλος or summum
bonum ; for the question of the highest moral duty of man is
identical with that of the highest good, and this with that of
happiness; for happiness is the possession of the good, and
the good is that which all desire. What is then the good, and
what is the highest good, the end and rule of human action
(Stob. Ecl. Eth. II. p. 56 τέλος οὗ ἕνεκα πάντα πράττεται
καθηκόντως, αὐτὸ δε πράττεται οὐδενὸς ἕνεκα)2

13. Every living being, so they reason, is endowed by
nature with the instinct of sels-love and sels-preservation,
impelling it to seek that which satisfies and is necessary for
its own nature (Diog. Laert. VII. 85 τὴν αὑτοῦ σύστασιν
καὶ τὴν ταύτης συνείδησιν).ι This is for that being qood,
and in the attainment of this consists its happiness (πρῶτα
κατὰ φύσιν, ea, quae sunt secundum acturam). Manis further-
more endowed with reason distinguishing him from the brute
creation3 nothing can therefore bc yood for him which does
not satisfyhis reason. The desire 'of knowledge impels him
to inquire into all that he sees aronnd him,and by observation
and compar-ison he becomes aware of the order and harmony
of the universe3 and so he reaches the conception that the
highest good, the greatest happiness, for him is a conformity
with the general constitution of nature. De Fin. III. 6, 21 ς
Marc. Aurei. VI. 44 συμφέρει δὲ ἑκάστῳ τὸ κατὰ τὴν ,ἑαυτοῦ
κατασκευὴν καὶ φύσιν· ἡ δὲ ἐμὴ φύσις λογικὴ καὶ πολιτική.9
There are many expressions for this idea. Stob. Ecl. Eth. ΙΙ.
