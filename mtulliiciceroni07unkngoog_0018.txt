14. Since, now, the highest good is grounded in the univer-
sal constitution of nature-and a virtuous life consists in con-
formity to it, we have at once the conception of law which
the individual is bound to obey. The universe is governed

by mind or reason; this reason is omnipresent, immortal,
perfect, governing the world and all that is therein 3’ the
maker‚ and, as it were, the father of all, the power of the
everlasting law, commanding what is right and forbidding
what is wrong3⁸ (Ibid. ξ 4o): he is the lawgiver3 and
duty consists in following his commands. But obedience to
the moral law is not so much an obligation imposed from
without as it is a necessity of man’s own nature. The reason
that dwells in him is a part of the universal reason 3⁴ and he
cannot conceive of himself as endowed with reason, without
at the same time feeling bound by its judgments. So that
conscience is our own right reason commanding the right and
forbidding the wrong by divine authority. Diog. Laert„ VII.
88, says: The highest good is to live in harmony with nature,
that is, according to one's own nature and that of the whole;
doing nothing that is forbidden by the common law, which is
right reason pervading all things the same with Zeus3 . . .

and the virtue of the happy man consists in this, that every-

the two hundred und eighty-eightfines bonorum mentioned by Marcus
Ἴωνος and at the beginning of Chapter IV. goes on to sayt Si erqo
