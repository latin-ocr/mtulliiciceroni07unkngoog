thing is done in harmony with the individual reason according
to the will of the governor of all things.¹ ·

15. This is the absolute good 3 and as a matter of theory the
Stoics did not admit any other. Chrysippus says (Plut. de
Stolo. Rep. 5, 2) ἐν τῷ κατ’ ἀρετὴν βιοῦν μόνον ἐστὶ τὸ εὔδαι-
μόνως, τῶν ἄλλων οὐδὲν ὄντων πρὸς ἡμᾶς οὐδ’ εἷς τοῦτο συνερ·
γοίἰντων. All other things, however important they may be
to our life, such as health, riches, honor, and even life itself‚
are not qood, any more than their oppositeS, sickness, poverty,
disgracc, or death, are evi13 they are ἀδιάφορα. It was not de-
nied that there was a certain difference in these things, some
being good in themselves, and others good as a means of at-
taining the good; but, strictly speaking, nothing was good,
which, 'like riches, might under any circumstances tend to evil '3
only that was good which was unconditionally so, the differ·
enee between good and evil being one of nature, not of degree.'
Further, if ¹the good. is defined, as Socrates defined it, to be
the usqfuI, then virtue alone is useful, utility is identical with
right. Stob. II. 188 εἶναι γὰρ τὸ ὠφελεῖν ἰ’σχειν κατ’ ἆρετὴιῑ
καὶ τὸ ὦψελεῖσθαι κινεῖσθαι κατ’ ἀρετήν. So that in the end
happiness is idcntical with virtue, the good and the useful
with conduct conformable to reason, and there is no good but'
virtue. ⁸

16. The Stoica especially insisted that pleasure was not a
good, or, as Epicurus held, the highest end of life 3 to allow this
was in their view to deny the very essence of good. Although
a sort of pleasure‚ rather χαρά, madium, than ἡδονὴ, laetitia,
voluptas, does undoubtedly accompauy the practice of vir·
tue, yet this was not an aim, constituent part, or condition of
moral action, but only a natural consequencc; Diog. Laert.
