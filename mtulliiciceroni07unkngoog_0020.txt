VII. 94 ἐπιγεννῆματα δὲ τήν τε χαρὰν καὶ γὴν εὖφροσίονην καὶ
τὰ παραπλήσια. Virtue is all-sufficient for happiness, it is its
own reward3 and it is called in this respect τέχνη εὐδαιμονίας
ποιηταί, (Alex. Apbr. de An. 156, b, o); and so complete is
this αὒταρκία of virtue, that the happiness cannot be increased
by time, the virtuous man is completely happy and indepen-

dcnt of all ontward things.
1'7. But man is not only endowed with reason, he has at

the same time certain passions repugnant to reason3 and
as virtue is conformity te, so vice is the contradiction of,
right reason. Passion is such a condition of the ἡγεμονικόν,
or reason,-that the reason- is violently impelled· to something

· contrary to itself3¹ it is an internal change, not a condition

superinduced from without3 it is an error of judgment3 vir-
tue is wisdom, vice is ignorance.¹ And the passions are in
our own· power3 they are, moreover, disturbanees of the health,
and may become actual diseases, of the soul; real virtue can
exist only when they arc‘completcly suppressed.⁸

18. Virtue, then, negatively considered, is freedom from the
passions, ἁπάθειαε positively it is subjection to the general
law of nature, and a government of one’s self'according to
reason. Hence it is entirely a matter of reason, and may be
called simply rightly regulated reason (Tusc. Disp. IV. 15, 34
ipsa virtus brevissime recta ratio dici potest). Moreover, it
contains two elements, one theoretica} and another practical.
The root and condition of all virtuous action is right knowl-
edgc; virtue is knowledge, vice is ignorance (Diog. Laert. VII.
93 εἶναι δ’ ἀγνοίας τὰς κακίας, ὧν αἱ ἀρεταὶ innormans„ but
virtue is also health and strength, the right and harmonicus
constitution of the seul. It is, in fine, such a union of the prac-
tical with the theoretical that action is based upon knowledge,
