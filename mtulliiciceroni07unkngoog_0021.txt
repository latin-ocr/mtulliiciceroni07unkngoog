and knowledge finds its expression in right action3 it is force of
will based upon knowledge, these being inseparably connected.¹

19. From wisdom (σοφία) as the foundation of all virtuous ac-
tion proceed 3 number of virtues, which the Stoics‚ after the
example of Plato, ranged under the four cardinal virtues,¹
F irst, φρόνησις, prudentia, the knowledge or judgment of good
and evil3 second, ἀνδρεία, fortitudo, or the knowledge of what
is to be endured or not to be endured; third, σωφροσῦνη, tem-
perantia, the knowledge of what to choose or avoid3 fourth,
δικαιοσύνη, iustitia, the knowledge of what rightly belongs to
all. In practice, prudence is right judgment as to the right
or wrong of an action3 fortitude, the seat-less obedience to

what is right and the courage to act3 temperance, restraint of -

the appetites and lower impulses3 justice, rendering ιο 311 per·
sons what is just-ly their duc.⁸

20. These virtues are coordinat& they all fiow from the
same source and tend to the same goul. Where one virtue is,
or one vice, there we find 2113 and a single right ¹action οοῑι-Ι
tains all the virtues, since it is t-hc intention or the will that
makes the action virtuous.⁴ ¹

21. An actionis completely virtuous when it is not only
good in itself, but springs from 3 good intention3 the inten-
tion is the cssence of the action3 the will to do right, though
it fail of performance, is equally good; Seu. de Ben. VI. 11,
3 voluntas est, quae apud nos ponit officium ; the wrong de-
sire is as bad as the wrong action3 Cic. Parad. ΙΙΙ. 1 nec enim
peccata rerum eventu, sed vitiis hominum metienda sunt. Here-
in lies the differcnce between the κατόρθωμα and the καθῆκονε
