the καθῆκον is every reasonable action (quod ita sactum aaut
eius facti probabilis ratio reddi possit, De Fin. ΙΙΙ. 17, 58),
every persor-mance of duty in general, and according to tho
circumstances; the κατόρθωμα is the complete performance,
the action not only reasonable in itself, but performed from a
right inte‘ntion3 it is a καθῆκον πάντας ἐπέχον τοῦς ἀρίθμους.ι
It follows from this that au completely good actions are
equal in worth, as all bad actions are equal in demerit, ἰ’σα τὰ
ἁμαρτήματα καὶ τὰ κατορθώματα :² virtue is indivisible3 itis pos·
sessed either completely or not at all.

22. This virtuous action, κατόρθωμα, can proceed only from
a perfect man, the sapiens? who has a perfect intention and
nnerring judgmcnt of good and evil3 and as there is no gra-
dation from the good to the bad action, so there is none from
the good to the bad man3 a man is either wholly good or
wholly bad.⁴ Mankind is therefore divided, according to the
Stoice, into wise and foolish. The sapiens is all-wisc, all-vir·
tuous; he alone is free, because dependent entirely upon bim-
self} beautiful, because only virtue makes one so; rich and
happy, because mental and moral endowments are the truest
riches3 in short, he is the embodimcnt of everything that is
to be desired.‘

23. TheStoic system, as thus set forth, is in the main log-
ical and consistent3 but evidently any attempt to apply it to
the facts of common life would meet with failure. They
themselves acknowledged that the ideal sapiens had almost
never existed3 Zeno himself did not claim to be such, and his
followers could hardly aspire to be better than he. They were
essentially practical in their general tone; and therefore easily
conceded much in applying their scicntific theol-ies to the facts
