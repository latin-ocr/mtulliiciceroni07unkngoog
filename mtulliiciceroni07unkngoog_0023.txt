xvi INTRODUOTION.

of common life. Although‚ as matter of theory, virtue was
the only good, it could not be denied that many things were
either necessary or helpful to the common man3 hence these
could not all be ἀδιάφορα, οι· indifferent. Then all those things
which satisfy the instinct of sslf-preservation‚ the πρῶτα κατὰ
φύσιν, must have a vulne, and that testing upon the eonstitu-
tion of human nature3 ¹ this was in fact the first step in the
reasouing which led to the idea of the summum bonum.
Moreover, if all these external things were ἀδιάφορα, no room
would be left for a reasonable choice‚ none for the exercise of
wisdom3 in fine, no motive for action.²

24. A further division was then made of the ἀδιάφορα into
three classes· The first contained things which, although
absolutely neither good nor evil, have yet a relative worth,
either a's being adapted -to human nature, or as being helpful
to the moral Πίος these are the προηγμένα, the preferable or
desirable things. The second claSS, the ἀποπροηγμένα, arethe
reverse, things that are to be rejected, undesirable. Between
these is the third claSS‚ the ἀδιάφορα in a restricted sense,
things which are either absolutely indifferent, or of so vague a
character as to excite neither desire nor aversion. Examples
of προηγμένα are mental endowments‚ good natural disposiss
tion, special aptitudes, beauty, strength, health, life itself, richeS‚
honor, noble descent, ete.; the opposites are ἀποπροηγμένα.
Instances of the ἀδιάφορα are, whether the number of the
hairs of one’s head are odd or eveu3 whether Ῑ use one piece
of money or another to pay a debt.

25. The Stoics endeavored to maintain all these distinctions
in practice 3 but this was almost impossible, and the authorities
differ very much in the terms they employ. Even Chrysippus
is said to have declared it absurd not to desire health and
riches, and to have permitted the statesman to regard riches
and honor as es'sentiall y good.⁴
