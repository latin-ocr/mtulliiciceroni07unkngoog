26. These concessione led naturally to a modification of the

idea of duty. The κατόρθωμα was explained above to be an
action good in itself and procceding from a right intention,
containing all -the‘elemcnts of right. The object of such an
action is the absolute good3 and if this alone were admitted
to be the object of our actione, there could bc but onc duty.
But when that which is relatively good· is admitted to bc
morally desirable, the idea and sphere of duty are cnlarged.
DutieS,¹ τὰ καθήκοντα, from this point of view, are divided
into complete duties, binding under all circumstanceS‚ κατορθώ·
ματα, oeaoa'yxovra τέλεια,’τὰ ἀεὶ καθῆκοντα, perficium officium,
οἵας and middle dutieS, μέσα καθήκοντα, τὰ μὴ ἀεὶ καθήκοντα,
officia media, which are concerned with thc προηγμένα, and
vary according to circumstances?

³ The use of the expression τὸ καθῆκον offers some difficulty, as it appears
in some passages to include, in others to exclude, the κατόρθωμα. R. Hir-nel
(Untcrsuchungen zu Cicero’s Philosophischen Schriften, 11. Theil, Leipzig,
1882) has attempted to distinguish an earlier and a later usage. He main·
taius (p. 405 ff.) that tlie popular signification of the word was ‘⁴ that which
is fitting ;” that Zeno first restricted this to,¹ “ that which hus a probable
justification ” (D. L. V11. 25), denoting thereby the μέσα :aericum-a as
distinguished from κατορθώματαε that the luter Stoica,- probably Panae·
tius und >his followers, returned to the popular usage, and, using καθῆκον
in the general and popular sense, dirided it into τὸ ἀεὶ καθῆκον (identicul
with τὸ κατόρθωμα), and τὸ οὐκ ἀεὶ καθῆκον. The proper interpretation
of the defiuition in D. L. VII. 107 is in question: καθῆκον φασὶν εἶναι ὃ
πραχθὲν εὔλογόν τιν’ ἴσχει ἀπολογισμόνε und so Stob. Ecl. Eth. 11. 158.
llirzel (ibid. p. 341, note 1) holds that εὔλογος has here the signification
of ‘⁴probablc”(walarsclzcinlick), and not that of “ reasonablc” (vernunsta‘y);
that “ a probable justification’' is one based ou the probability that certain
actions will be useful to us (ea'ne solche, die auf die Walersckeinlichkeit
Ῑιίηωείει, dass qewisse Handlunyen uns nittzliclt sein werden). In this
sense, of course, the κατόρθωμα is excluded. Zeller (Die Philosophia
der Griechen, etc., 111.⁸ pp. 265, 266, note 2) takes the definition us a
general -one,including τὸ κατόρθωμα. Cicero gives the same definitior:
in Dc Off. 1. 3, 8, and De Fin. 111. 17, 58, applying it to the »taedia offi-
cia,· and in the first passage he opposes it to ,τὸ κατόρθωμα. - Hirzel
thinks that Panaetius omitted the general definition of duty, which Cicero

criticises in 1. 2, ’1, because, us he understood it in the popular sense, it
was uunecessary.
