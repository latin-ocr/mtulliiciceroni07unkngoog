xviii INTRODUOTION.

27. The latter are the only duties that have an interest for
mankind. The standard of right action is conformity with
right reason3 we ean only judge of this conformity by the
exercise of our own reason, or conscience3 if that were all-
wise, so as to embrace the complex chain of causes and effect-s
in the universe, our judgments would be sure, we should be
sapientes, and our actions κατορθώματα. But as our reason is
more or less liinited, our judgment can only be partial, and

ratio probabilis reddi possit). All dutics fall under this head3
and these are the subjects of the paraenetic or advisory por-

Stoics; but after Chrysippus it formed a separate division,
and especial attention was devoted to it in later timeS. Cice-

29. Panaetius gave more attention to thc practical side of
philosophy, in harmony with the spirit of the time3 he aimed
to present his subject in a popular and tasteful manner, abat-
ing somewhat of the scientific severity of his predecessore.
To some extent he took an independent course in his teach-
ings; and willingly aeknowledged the merits and adopted
