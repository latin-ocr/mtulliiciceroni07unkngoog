INTaoDUcTION. xix

virtues the‘ Aristotelian division of duties into dianoetie and
practieal. His famous work, Περὶ καθήκοντος, was a practical
treatise, intended not for the ideal sage, but for the common
man of the world.

30. His book was divided, as Cicero tells us (1. § 9), into
three parts3 the first treated of duties derived from thc idea
of right3 the second those from the idea of expediency; and
the third, which for some reason he failed to write, would

“ have discussed the cases of conflict between the two classes.

31. Cicero criticises this division in Ι. ἕ 9 as being incom-
plete, and proposes instead another into five parts; the duties
flowing from the honestum ,· the question which of two honesta
is to be preferred3 the utile ; the question which of two utilia
is to be preferred3 and, lastly, the conflict between the kones-
tum and the utile.

32. The first part occupies the greater portion of the first
book, as far as c. 43, and is based on the work of Panaetius.
The second part, oecupyiug only the remaining three chap-
ters, waS, if we may judge from c. 45 and from Ep. ad Att.
XVI. 11, 4, based on a work of Posidonius, Panaetius is
again the model for the third part, which is treated in the
second book, as far as ξ 86. For the brief remaining portion,
containing all that is said on the fourth head, a work of An-
tipater of Tyre, mentioned in ἓ 86, seems to have been the
foundation.⁴

’ 33. For the fifth part, which occupies the whole third book,
’ Cicero claime to have relied on himself. It ie, however, prob-
able that he used to some extent the work of Posidonius (see
g 88); and a· book of Hecato, a pupil of PanaetiuS, was still
more useful‚ unless perhaps his knowledge of it was gathered
from the summary (τὰ κεφάλαια), mentioned in the letter to
Atticus.¹

34. We see, then, that in the De Finibus, where the discus-
sion is theoretical, the author is undecided iu his vieWS‚ but
rather opposed to the Stoics; in the present work hc adopts
