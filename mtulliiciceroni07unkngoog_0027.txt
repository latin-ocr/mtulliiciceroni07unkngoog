the Stoic classification, and uses it as a framework for his own
thoughts, although there is little in the development of ideas
to conflict with the Peripatetic teachings. He occasionally
refers to the similarity of his own views to the latter, as for
instance iu Ι. 1, 2. It is of course not possible to say how
closely he followed Panaetius in the first two books3 it is
natural to suppose that the examples from Roman history
were his own3 aud so doubtless were many of the reflectious
suggested by them. Iu the general tone there is very little
in the whole work that would be foreign to modern ideas.
The author holds the existence of an innate moral sense (Tusc.
Disp. ΙΙΙ. 1, 2 sunt enim ingeniis nostris semina innata virtu-
tum ; quae si adolescere liceret, ipsa nos ad beatam vitam mz-
tura perduceret); the good is an inherent quality of actious}
and this is never changed by any consideration of expedieney.
No assertion occurs oftener with him than that nothing is ex-
pedient which is not also good (nihil, praeter id quod kones-
tum sit, propter se esse expetendum). The honestum is what
it is by nature, it is not a matter of -opiniou3 De Leg. Ι. 16,
44 nec solum ius et iniuria natura diiudicatur, sed omnino
omnia honesta et turpia ; and so 17, 46. ·

ular of Cicero's works. Pliny· (H. N. Praef.§ 22) speaks of
the books as volumi-na ediscenda, non modo in manibus coti·
die habenda. St. Ambrose eomposed a work with the same ti-
tle, following very nearly the same plan. Melanchthon wrote
a commentary on Cicero’s book, and says non alius exstat
libellus de moribus absolutior officiis Ciceronis. Erasmus did
not doubt quin illud pectus, unde ista prodierunt, aliq-ua di·
vinitas⁴ occuparit. Frederick the Great prouounced it “the
best work ou morals that has been or can be written.’'

36. Later critics are not so indulgent. Prof. Mommsen,
for instance (Rom. Gesch. ΙΙΙ), 607 ), considers Cicero’s
“philosophieal library,” scr-ibbled off in a couple of monthS‚
a complete failure; and if the works are judged as scientific
treatise5‚ there is a great deal of justice in the criticism. The
truth lies perhaps between the two extremes3 auditis hardly
