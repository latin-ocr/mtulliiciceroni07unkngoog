fair to apply a standard which the author himself would have

, disclaimed. The De Officiis is doubtless incompleta, in some

parts confused, inconsistent, and disfigured by careless writ-
ing. But Cicero tells us what to expect from his philosoph-
ieal works: Ep. ad Att. XII. 52 Ἀπόγραφα aunt ; minore Ζα-
bore fiunt ,· verba tantum affere, quibus abundo ,· aud we know
that circumstances made this unavoidable. They have, not-
withstandiug, a very great value, since they give us an idea at
least of other works that are lost3 and they have always found
admiring readers.

37. The MSS. of the De Officiis are very numerous. They
have all come from a common source, but may be divided into
two classes; at the head of one stand the Beruensis e, of the
13th century, and the Palat. p; of the other family the best
are a MS. at Barnberg, one at VViirzburg, the MS. b at Berne,
all dating from the tenth century.

38. The text of the present edition is mainly that of C. F.
W. Miiller, Leipzig, 18793 and an Adnotatio Critica, giving
the variations from the tegits of Baiter, in the Ziirich and the
Leipzig editionS, from the fifth of Heine, 1878, aud occasion-
ally from other editors, may be found at the end of the notes.
In a few instanees where Miiller's text has been altered, the
changes will be found noted in the proper place in the Ad-
notatio, and often explained in the notes.

39. In writing the noteS, various editions have been con-
stantly consulted, for there is hardly any ancient classic where
the material is so abundant. The mass of matter has now be-
come a sort of common property; but especial aeknowledg-
ment is due to the edition of Heine in the VVeidmann series,
Berlin, 1878, many of whose notes have been substantially
translated here; and the whole book has had the very great
advantage of a careful revision by Professor Drisler. The
sketch of the Stoic philosophy given above is drawn mainly
from Zeller, Die Philosophia der Grieehen in ihrer Gesehieht-
lichen Entwiekelun'g‚ Leipzig, 1880.
