'Boox 1. 3

has a wider scope than any other. It may be treated under
two heads—justice and liberality. .

Of justice, in this narrower sense, the first duty is never to
do a wrong to any one unless we have sufficient provocation;
the second, to use things which belong to all persons in com-
mon, as well as one‘s own property, without violating the rights
of others, We should try to draw closer the bonds of human
society (22) by an interchange of good offices3 aud good saith,
or steadfastness and truth in all our sayings and dealings, is
the foundation of justice.

Of injustice (23) there are two kinds3 the first, where a per·
son inflicts a wrong on another3 the second, where he neglects
to prevent a wrong being done to another.

· The most common motive for inflicting injuries (24) is the
desire of obtaining undue power or riches. The most am-
bitious men desire wealth (VIII. 25) in order to gain influence
in the state, and to he able to distribute largesseS, as was the
case with Crassus3 some care much for a brilliant style of liv-

to others, But men oftener forget justice (26) when they are
carried away by the thirst for honor, power, and glory, as G.
Caesar was, A premeditated wrong (27) is more blameworthy
than one committed under the impulse of passion.

There are several causes of neglect to prevent injustice to
others (IX. 28): reluctance to incur labor and expense, neg-
ligence, sloth, or devotion to one's own occupations. The
philosopherS, perhaPS, fall into this error.

It is much easier to judge rightly in regard to the duties
of other persons (29) than in regard to our own; hence it is
well (30) never to do anything as to the rightfulness of which
we have any doubt.

But'cases often occur when duty varies (X. 31) according
to circumstances3 in these we must aim to act in such a way
that injury shall be done to no one, and consult the common
good. Sometimes the execution of a promise is inexpedient
(32) to one or the other of the parties. Promises are not to
be kept when the fulfilment would work a greater injury to-
