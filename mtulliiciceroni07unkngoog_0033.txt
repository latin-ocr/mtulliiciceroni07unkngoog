the person promising than the benefit accruing to the other
party. Promises made nuder compulsion are not binding.

Injustice is often done by a dishonest interpretation of a
promise (33).

There are certain duties (XI) to be observed towards those
who have wronged us3 for instance, those with whom we are
at war. Wars may be waged to prevent aggression (35) ; the
conquered should be humauely treated, and an honorable peace
be the aim. A declaration should always (36) precede actual
operatione. Wars for conquest (38) are to be carried on more
humanely than others.-

, Promises made to aa enemy (XIII. 39) should bc fulfilled.
Regulus acted rightly in returning to Carthage according to
his promise; and the censors branded the captives whom Han-
nibal sent to Rome (40) after the battle of Cannae. The de-
sertcr from Pyrrhus was properly sent back.

From slav es (41) we may require labor⁸ but must treat them
justly· , and of all injustice none is greater thau the pretence
of right when one is doing wrong.

Libet-alim, the second part of justice (XIV. 42), requires
much cantion. Care should be taken not to barm either the
recipients or other persons, as happened, for instance (43), in
the confiscations and largesses of Sulla and Caesar. Again,
liberality should be proportioned (44) to one’s ability, that
other just claims may not be neglected. Thirdly (45, 46),
regar-d ,should be had to the character of those who receive
the bounty, and to our relations or obligations towards them.

Our benevolence is, above all, due to those (47) who love us
most3 and, if in addition they have conferred benefits on us
(48), we are still more bound to make a generous return.
Kindness done with discretiori and thoughtfulness (49) is
worthy of more regard than that done from impulse3 and,
other things being equal, assistance should rather be given to
those who have the greatest need.

But we shall best serve the interests of society (50) if wc
are benevolent to others in proportion to their relationship to

us; and to judge rightly of this we must inquire somewhat
