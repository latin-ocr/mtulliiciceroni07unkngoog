into the natural principles of human society. Reason and
speech are the bond which unites us and distinguishes us from
the brutes. This universal brotherhood (51) should be main-
tained by the observance of law, or, where there is no law, by
a kindly regard for the needs of our follow-men. One should

so it is defined by the Stoics as “ virtue contending for equity.’'
The difficulty here is that large-mindcdness (64) is often at-
tended with ambition and an inordinate desire for power.
True greatness of mind cares less for glory (65) than for
doing ri ht.

Fortitffaede (XX. 66) is shown in two ways: the first, an it?-

useful, difficuln and dangerous undertakings. The latter most
