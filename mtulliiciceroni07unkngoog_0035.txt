atti-acts attention (67); the former is the essence of the virtue.
This is seen in two things: a persuasion that nothing is right
which is 'not good; and a perfect tranquillity of mind. The
excessivo desires (68) of pleasure, money, and glory are evil.
A quiet mind should be our aim (69); for this philosophers
and serious men often retirc from public life. They may. per-
haps be excused3 their life is easier (XXI. 70), though less
useful and glorious than a public one. Especially are they
excusable (71) if they retire for study or any serious reason;
but false pride and despondency are evil. If one is fitted by
nature (7 2) he should engage in public life, without,.however,
giving up his independence (73); and before undertaking any-
thing be sure of the means to accomplish it.

The common idea that military glory (XXII. 74) ιε much
greater than that gained in civil life is not always correct.
Solon (75) did as much for his country as Themistocles3 we
may cite too the examples of Pausanias (7 6) and Lysander,
ScauruS, Marius, and other cases in Roman life3 and Cicero’s
own success (77, '7 8) in quelling the insurrection of Catiline.

Although the body should be trained to endurance (ΧΧΙΙΙ.
79), it is the mind that is required here3 and hence civilians
often accomplish more in war than those who actually carry
it on.

A brave and steadfast man (80) should never lose his
presence of mind, and never be surprised (81) by an unfore·
seen difficulty.

A great man treats a conquered enemy (XXIV. 82) justly,
punishing only the guilty. Timidity must be shunned on the
one hand (83), rashness on the other. We should be more
ready to expose ourselves than the state to danger, and even
sacrifice our own fame to the public good. Many have been
willing to give up everything (84) for. their country but their
own glory, like Callicratidas and Cleombrotus; it was not so
with Q. Maximus,

Those who are in public office (XXV. 85) must take care,
first, that they serve the public interest rather than their own;
secondly, that they serve the whole state, not a mere party.
