From party-serving come sedition and discord. So at Athens
(86), and at Rome in the civil wars. It ιε 3 pitiable atrise,
that for public office.

Personal enemies should be mildly treated (88); and in a
republic courtesy in one’ s bearing, clemency, and justice in
inflicting punishments (89) are all needfnl.

Arrogance in prosperity (XXVI. 90) is the mark of a light
mind3 an equable temperament and bearing are praiseworthy,
as was seen in Socrates, Laelius, and Philip of Macedon. The
counsel of friends (91) will aid us in this matter. In fine (92)
public life affords means for the widest influence, private life
for honorable usefulness

XXVII. 93—XLIII. 151. Temperantia. The fourth virtue
includes modesty and grace, temperanee, moderatiori, sels-con·
trol‚ and order. Under this head also comes decorum, which
the Greeks call πρέποι. Strictly speaking, decorum is inherent
in all right actions, for everything which is right is fitting3
but it is more apparent in this fourth class, where moderatiori
and temperance, with a sort of dignity‚ arc the most prominent
qualities. It is difficnlt to define3 but it is the same harmony
(97) of the words and actions with the character and eircum-
stances of 3 person, which the dramatic poets observe m writing
their plays3 and as beauty of person (98) gives pleasure, so
this decorum brings the approbation of all those with whom
we come in continet. Hence we should always cultivate (99)
3 sort of deference towards others, and especially towards the
best men.

The duty which flows from this (100) consists, firstly, in
following the guidance of nature3 and this will lead us to the
practice of all the virtues, but especially of the virtue now in
question. The constitution of our mind (101) is a twofold
one3 there are the appetites (ὁρμαί) and the reason to govern
them. All action (XXIX) should be well considered and
should proceed from rational grounds; the appetitos should
neither go beyond nor fall short of the reason. Recreation
and sport (103) should be moderate3 jesting (104) may be
easily carried to excess-
