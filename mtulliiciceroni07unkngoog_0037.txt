But we must always keep in mind (XXX. 105) the dif-
ference between the nature of man and that of the lower
anima1s3 the latter are governed by appetite, the former by
reason. Pleasure (106) should be moderate, and sober living
is better than luxury.

We may also observe in ourselves two >characters (107):
one common to us with our fellow·men‚ distinguishing us from
the brute creation3 the other peculial· to us as individuals.
There are the same differences in our minds as in our bodies;
and this may be illustrated (108, 109) by many examples.

So far as we do not act against nature in the general sense
(XXXI. 110), we may follow our own individua] characters3
in fact, unless we do so (111), nothing can be really fitting.
So true is this that there are some situations in life in. which
suicide (112) is a duty for one man, but would be blame·
worthy in another. Cato and his associates illustrate this dif-
ference. Ulysses and Aiax (113) are examples of opposite
characters, Each person, therefore (114), should choose the
course of life most consonant with his natural gifts, as the
actors choose their parts in a play.

Besides these two characters there is a third (XXXII. 115)
which chance or circumstances imposc upon us3 and a fourth,
the result of our own choice. Our station in life 1s a matter
of chance3 the manner in which we fill it depends upon our·
selveS. We choose a profession, either (116) that of our
fathers or ancestors‚ or a different one, often at an age (117)
when we are least competent to do so3 for not all of us can
make the deliberate choice of Hercules (118).

It sometimes happens that men of great genius or acquire-
ments (XXXIII. 119) are able themselves to select their ca-
reer; in this case natural gifts, rather than external circum-
stanceS, should determine their choice. When this is once
fixed‚ it should be persevered in3 but if a change is necessary
(120), it should be thoughtfully made. In imitating our an·
cestors (121) of course their faults are to be avoided3 we may

at least emulate their virtues.
Duties differ also (XXXIV. 122) for the old and the young.
