. Boon 1. 9

The young should respect the old and follow their counsel,
avoid excesses, train the mind and the body. Old men (123)

should aid others with counsel, and especially be ready to .

serve the state; they ought never to yield to languor, sloth,
or luxury. Magistrates (124) must maintain the dignity of
the state, private persons be good citizens. Foreigners (125)
should not meddle in what does not concern them.

Something must be said too (XXXV. 126) in regal-d to
our conversation, dress, and general bearing. Some subjects
are unsuitable for conversation ; in this matter (129) we must
avoid effeminacy on the one hand and coarseness on the other.

There are two kinds of beauty (XXXVL 130), that in
which grace and elegance are the principal elemeuts, aul that
which consiste in manly dignity. The latter should be ap-
parent in all the motions of the body, in our personal habits
and dress; everything like affectation should be shunned.

In conversation (XXXVII) great care should be given to
the tone of voice (133), the style (134), and the choice of sub· ·
jects. Dignity of bearing (XXXVIII. 136) and courtesy
towards others are necessary3 or if at times severity be re-
quired, let it'be used with moderatiori.

One’s dwelling (XXXIX. 138) should befit his position3
and the house (139) be known from the master, not the master
from the house. How many have imitated the grandeur, how
few the virtue, of Lucullus (140)!

In all actions three things (141) are essential: that the ap-
petites obey the reason, that all effort be proportioned to the
object in view, and that moderatiori be obser-ved in all things.

Finally (XL. 142), we come to order (εὐταξία), οι· the saying
and doing things at the right time and in the right place. As
in a discourse, so in life (144), all things should fit together.
The greater violatione of propriety are easily observed; but,
as a musician detects discorde which escape the ordinary ear,
we may often by giving close.attention (146) draw weighty
conclusione from trivial things, In case of doubt (147) the
advice of others may be useful. It is au error (148) to ex-
pect for ourselves such an indulgence in these matters as was
