10 SUMMARY.

shown to Socrates or Aristippus, Every one is entitled to our
respect (149) according to his character, age, and position.

There are many occupations in which an honorable man
may not engage. Such are those which are distasteful to
other personS‚ those of money-leaders, birelings, retail dealers,
artisans, etc.; where considerable skill is required, a calling
may be respectable for those of a corresponding position, ·
commerce, if conducted on a large scale, is not to be dispar-
aged; but agriculture is of all pursuits the most worthy of a
free man (150,151).

XLIII. 152. Compar-ison of two honesta. Cases some-
times arise in which we have to decide which of two right
actions is to be preferred. The general rule (153) is that
duties which concern the interests of society take precedence
of those relating to mere knowledge. For knowledge itself,
in its most general sense, has to do with the fellowship of gods
and men3 and if this is the highest knowledge, the duties
·arising from it must also be the highest. But this knowledge
is useless unless it be employed in action, and especially in the
service of others3 and this is shown by the conduct of the
best men. Every one would lay aside other duties in ease
of danger to his country (154), his relations, or friends. So
'the greatest studente have never withdrawn themselves from
these responsibilities (XLIV. 155); if not in person, they have
served others by their books. And eloquence (156) is better
·than study alone. Men are born social beings (157); hence
knowledge, apart from this association‚ is empty, and fortitude
may become brutality. It is not true, as some say (158), that
human society took its origin from the need of mutual aid in
supplying men's wants; for, even if all these were supplied by
magio, man would shrink from solitude.

These duties are not always, however, to take precedence of
that of temper-auce (XLV. 159) 3 for some actions are so base
as not to be allowable on any consideration. As to the order
of common duties (160) we should arrange them thus: first,
those to the gods; second, those to our country; third, those
to relations3 and next, the others in order.
