BOOK 11.

 

SUMMARY.

1.1-11.s. 13 1113 introduction Cicero meets the criticisms
of those who had blamed his retirement from public life, and
explains (7) the apparent inconsistency of professing Academie
or sceptical opinions and, at the same timo ,laying down posi·
tive rules of duty. ·

The second book proper treats of duties under the second
general head of Panaetius, that of expediency (utile); or, ae-
cording to Cicero’ 3 division (Book Ι. ξ 10),1113 1111ι·(1 head,
utile (ΙΙΙ. 9—XXIV. 87), aud the fourth head, the comparisou
of two utilia (XXV. 88, 89).

are appeased by piety and sanctity, and cannot be supposed to
wish to injure us3 next to them (12-15) it is to our fellow·men
that we look for aid in our pursuits3 aud we are dependent
on their services even in order to avail ourselves of the forces
aud objecta of inanimate nature. From'them come likewise
