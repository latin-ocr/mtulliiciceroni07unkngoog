and the treating with moderation and discernment our fellow-
men, who minister to our natural wantS, and defend ns from
injury by punishing those who do us wrong. N o doubt much
depends (19) in this matter on the caprice of fortune, but
(20) the agency of man is vastly more important.

VI. 21. The motives which induce men to render services
to others are: good· -feeling, desire to honor the virtuous or
worthy, confidence in another-’s character or discretion, fear
of another' s influence, hope of return, expectation of reward.
- And almost the same reasons (22) lead one man to submit
to the authority of another.

Of all these motives (VII. 23) that most adapted to secure
for us the services of others' is their qood-fieliny towards ns.
The example of Caesar proves how fatal is the hatred of men.
And this is so especially (24) in free states· Recall the ex-

thought to unite wisdom with justice, of these justice (34) is
the more important, mere ability without this only mspires

singular virtue, who are above the common vices (37); and
(XI. 38) especially to those who are noted for their justice,
and are not influenced by the love of money. A reputation
for uprightness (39) is necessary in all stations of life; even,
