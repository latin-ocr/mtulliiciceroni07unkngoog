at first good men, exalted to power in order to secure justice}
and laws were first made with the same design (42). True
glory ιε based on real worth (43); Socrates used to say, that
to obtain it most quickly one should really be that which he
wished to be considered.

A few practical directions (XIII. 44), may be given for this
purpose. Those born to high station have already a certain
distinction3 others (45) should cherish high aims, and espe-
cially strive for military glory. The first recommendation in a
young man (46) is modesty towards parents, kindly feeling
towards his equals3 it is well to cultivate the society of dis·
tinguished men.

Although eloquence (XIV. 48) contributes much to glory,
a genial manner in conversation is singularly effective. Elo-
quence, however, putting us in contact with a greater number
of persons, brings greater fame3 and especially the eloquence
of the advocate (49). The defense (50) is more popular than
Ι the accusation. One should never accuse an innocent person
(51), but may, at times, within certain limits, defend the
guilty.

We next consider the duty of Ζίὂεναῖἱε3] (XV. 52), which
is shown in two ways. by personal exertion or by gifts
of money. Of these the latter is easier, the former more
dignified. The latter exhausts the fountain of eharity3
with the former, by the act of giving we are made more
able to give (53). If money is given (54), it should be
done carefully and in moderation3 if the resources of the
giver aro exhaust-ed, he is led int-o wrong-doing to replenish
them. There is a difference (XVI. 55) between lavishness,
which is to be blamed, and liberality (56). Public games
have been always expected from the aediles, in which, of
course, any appearance of stinginess is to be avoided; but
each one must consult his own ability (XVII. 58). Modera·
tion (59) is the best rule. Money given for this purpose is
well expended in public works of permanent value (60).

In tho matter of liberality (XVIII. 61) we should be gov-
erned by circumstances, being more ready to aid the suffering
