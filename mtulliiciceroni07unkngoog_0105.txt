than those who merely wish to better their condition. Liber·
ality well bestowed (63) brings general popularity3 and even
in the ordinary transactions of life (64) it is better not to be
too exacting. Hospitality‚ both to our countrymen and to
foreigners, is rightly praised.

We may do good by personal exertion (XIX. 65), to the
state or to individuale. One may often gain much influence
and popularity by aiding others with advice3 and for this
reason the study of law was formerly held in great honor.
When this is beyond our power, we can give our eloquence
(66) or our influence (67) in their behalf, taking care, how-
ever (68), not to offend others·

In helping others (XX. 69, 70) it is generally recognized
that wc ought to consider the character rather than the posi-
tion of the person3 but we are very much prone to the eon-
trary. And yet the poor honest inan will always cher-ish
gratitude for a benefit, while the rich man will consider your
service to him as an interested action. Moreover‚ benefits to
the humble are appreciated by all of the same class. Try to

- satisfy all, if possible (71), but regard the man rather than his

money.

Finally, benefits conferred on the state (XXI. 72) may af-
fect the whole body of citizens, or individuale. We may aim
to accomplish both ends; but in benefiting individuals we must
do no harm to the community. A public official (73) should not
infringe on the rights of property, should avoid levying con-
tributione (74), if possible, by providing resources beforehand,
and never abuse his trust (75) for his own personal advan-
tage. This last has now become common, but (XXII. 76)
was not formerly s0, aS‚ for instance, with Scipio, P. Aemilius,
L. Mummius. Those who pass agrarian laws (78) or laws for
cancelling debts disturb the harmony of the citizens and offend
against justice itself; moreover‚ they do not attain their end
(79). So with the Lacedaemonians (XXIII. 80), the Gracchi 3
while Aratus of Sicyon (81 sq.) is universally praised. But
care must be taken that indebtedness does not increase (XXIV.
84) so as to become danger-cus to the stat03 in any case it
