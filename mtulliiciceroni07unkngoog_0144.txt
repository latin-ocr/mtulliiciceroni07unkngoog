BOOK ΙΙΙ.

 

SUMMARY.

· Ι. 1-Π, 6. In the introduction Cicero speaks of his en-
forced retirement from public life, comparing his own lot with
that of Scipio Africanus3 and again exhor-ts his son (5) to
profit as much as possible by his opportunities of study at
Athens. “

PanaetiuS‚ he says (7), divided the subject of practica] mo··
rality into three headS, consideriug under the first the question
whether an action was right3 under the second, whether an
action was expedient3 under the third, the conflict between
the two· He discussedthe first two points in the three pub·
lished books, but left his work -unfinished Many persons
think that the omission was intentional, because, from the
nature of the case, a conflict between what is right and what
is expedient is impossible.

That Panaetius intended to discuss this point (III. 11) can-
not be doubted; but whether he was justified in admitting
the existence of such a question is a matter on which opinions
may differ. Whether, with the Stoics, we hold that virtue is
the only good, or, with the Peripatetics, that nothing else is
of any weight in comparison with virtue, in neither case can
there be any conflict between right and expediency; and, as
’ Panaetius held the Stoic view (12), it would seem that he
could not have admitted the possibility of such a conflict.
But a completely virtuous action (13) can be performed only
by the sapiens ; other men attain only the semblance of such
conduct3 and the duties of which we are treating (14) are
the media officia, such as are performed by ordinary men.
