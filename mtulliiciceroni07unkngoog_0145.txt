116 SUMMARY.

see no difference (15) 3 the Decii (16), for instance, the Scipios,
and Fabricius were virtuous in the popular sense. Now in
reality neither of these kinds of honestum (17) are to be eom·-
pared with expediency3 but, as a matter of fact, those who
measure the valuc of things by expediency do really (18) make
such a comparison3 and it seems that Panaetius intended
to say that men are accustomed, but not that they ouyht, to
make it. ”

Where a doubt arises‚ it relates in fact to the nature of the
action‚'whether it is wrong or not; for an action (19) that is

generally held to bc wrong may upon certain occasions be
right. It is wrong to kill a man, but most noble to kin a

tyrant. Hence the need of some general principle.

This general rule is (V. 21) that to take a thing from an-
other man, or to cause another man any prejudice for our own
advantage, is more repugnant to nature than death, poverty,
pain, or other accidents to person or property; for it destroys
human society itself. And this rule is sanctioned (23) by the
civil law.

But it is still more plainly the dictate of the natural law3
for all the virtues (24, 25, 26) are evidently more iu harmony
with nature than the corresponding vices. Thus the interest
of the individual (VI) and that of the eommunity should be
considered as identical; all are bound (27) by the same law
of nature3 and we are no more excusable for violating the
rights of a stranger or a felloweitizen (28) than those of mem·-
bers of our own family.

Quaeritur (29), whether the wisc man (sapiens), when in
danger of starving, may take away food from a useless mem-
ber οἱ society3 or might he rob Phalaris of clothing to avoid
dying ofcoldi In the first case (30, 31) we answer in the
affirmative, on the ground of general expedicncy3 so, als0, in
the second case (32), because all tyr-ants ought to be killed as
enemies of the human racc. Of the same kind are all ques-
tions in regard to duty under various conditionS.

For these, however (VII. 33), enough has already been said
in the preceding books. At present we may adopt either the
