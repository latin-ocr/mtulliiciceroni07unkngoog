Stoic or the Peripatetic doctrine, while we attempt with our
own resources the discussion of the point which- was 'omitted
by Panaetius„

When we have occasion to consider an action that is ap-
parently expedient (VIII. 35), we must reinember that, if it
is wrong, it is not really expedient. From neglect of this pre-
caution (36) come all sorts of crimes3 and not even a doubt
(37) should be admitted. Nor should the possibility of es-
caping detection tempt us to wrong3 not even if we had the
ring of Gyges (IX. 38).

The question often arises (X. 40) whether an action which
seems expedient can be rightfully performed. Brutus was
justified in excluding Collatinus from the consular power; but
Romulus (41) did wrong to kill his brother Remus. We may
use every effort to further our own interests (42), if at the
same time we do no wrong to others.

Doubts more often arise in regard to duty when our friend·- ·

ships are involved (43). We should never neglect the dutics
of friendship for the sake of honor, richeS, or pleasure; on tbc
other hand, devotion to a friend must never lead us so far as
to violate our duty to the state, to break an oath or a promise.

In public affairs expediency (XI) often leads to wrong—doing,
as when we destroyed Corinth; but cruelty, such as that of
the Athenians towards the people of Aegina, is never expe-
dient. It is especially praiseworthy if a nation disregards ex-
pediency for the sake of right, as our own people did after the
battle of Cannae3 and the Athenians (48), when they decided
to meet Xerxes with their fleet3 and again, when they refused
to burn the Spartan fleet (49), as Themistocles advised.

In many cases (XII. 50) we have to consider whether what
is expedient is completely inconsistent with right, or may be-
reconciled with it. For instance, during a famine at Rhodes
a merchant arrives with a cargo of grain from Alexandria, and
knows that others are coming directly after him3 quaeritur,
whether he is bound to disclose that fact, or may sell at the
current price. Antipater (51) holds that he is bound to dis-
close it3 Diogenes says that, so long as. he acts within the
