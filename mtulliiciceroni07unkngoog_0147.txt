limits of the law, he has a right to sell for the highest price
he ean obtain. ²

If a man sells a house (XIII. 54) which, for reasons known
only to himself, is a very undesirable one, quaeritur, whether
he is bound to disclose these circumstances before fixing the
price. Antipater (55) decides in the affirmative3 Diogenes
dissents. Cicero (57) agrees in both cases with Antipater. ᾗ

If reticence is blameworthy (XIV. 58), much more so is
deception. We may cite the case of Pythius for an example,
who· sold a villa to Canius after giving him the impression
(59) that there was a great fishing-ground before it. But the
law of O. Aquilius had not then been passed for the punish-
ment of fraud (60); his definition of fraud was: “Wherefl
man pretends one thing, but does another.”

Fraud, then (XV. 61), is not to be suffered3 and this has
been provided against by the lawe„ as also by various forms
of action. Scaevola, indeed, once gave a higher price for an
estate (62) than was asked, which pcople in general would
think unwise3 but there again is the misusc of the word wis-
dom. Hecate (63) says that an honest man may consult his
own inteream, if he does not violate law or custom. It is true
that fraud is very common (64), and thoroughly upright men
are rare.

In the sale of lauded estates (XVI. 65) the law is, that
defects known to the seller must be disclosed to the buyer.
Claudius owned a house (66) on the Caelian hill, which hin-
dered the observations of the augurs. When ordered by them
to remove the obstruction he sold the house to Calpurnius,
concealing the fact. Cato held him liable for damages to
Calpurnius on that ground. A similar case was that of the
sale of a house by M. Marius Gratidianus to O. Sergius Orata.

The laws prevent fraud only so far as it can be reached by
special enactment3 but philosophers (XVII) apply the test of
reason and knowledge, and these forbid all unfair dealing, prc-
tence, or deecit. The civil law cannot punish everything (69)
that is wrong by the law of nature. Unfortunately we have
in common life only the shadow of true justice3 and would
