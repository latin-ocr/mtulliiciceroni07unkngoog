that we even followed this! ...It is often difficult (70), and
it even requires an ‚able judge, to decide between conflicting
claims. One of the greatest dangers (7 2) is when dishonesty
assumes the mask of wisdom.

A few difficult cases may be cited (XVIII. 73) by way of
example. A will was forged, purporting to have been made
by Basilus, in which Crassus and Hortensius were named as
co-heirs3 and yet they accepted the pretended legacy. They
acted wrongly; 'for it is not enough not to be the principal in
a wrong3 one must not be an accessory. An upright man
(XIX) will never do anything which would violate the rights
of others; he will never be a will-hunter. We ought to
avoid the thought eren (77) of what we should not dare to
s eak.

p'Phe greater the advantage to be gained (XX. 79), the greater

is the temptation to wrong. Marius was serving in the army
of Metellus, and, when sent by him with a message to Rome,
he intrigued against and supplanted his commander. Grati-
dianus made a premature announcement (80) to the people
of a law on the coinage, and so took the credit to himself
over his colleagues. Sometimes the advantage to be gained
(81) seems immeasurably greater than the wrong done to gain
it, as in the case of Marius just mentioned; but no advantage
can compensate (82) the loss of one’s reputation for honesty.

This it was that induced Pompey to marry the daughter of
Caesar (XXI). Caesar thought anything right if done for the
sake of power. This is a fat-al error3 if a man really thinks
thus, it is useless to argue with him. But power unjustly
obtained brings so much suffering (84) that it can hardly be
desirable. How could life be desirable to a man (85) whose
murderer is now considered a public benefactor?

Fabricius and the senate showed their opinion on this sub-
ject by sending back the deserter from Pyrrhus (XXII. 86) ;
but the senate did wrong (87) to make those states tributary
that had once bought from Sulla their exemption3 and Cato,
in my opinion, treated the publicans and the socii with far too
great severity. ’
