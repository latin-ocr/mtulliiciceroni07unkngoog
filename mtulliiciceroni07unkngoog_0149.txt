120· SUMMARY.

Hecate (XXIII. 89), in the sixth book “De Officiis,” pro-
poses and answers many questions of casuistry (89-92).

Among others (XXIV. 92) he asks whether bargains and
promises made in good saith are always to be kept. It would
seem that there are exceptions.

Promises are not to be kept (XXV. 94) when the fulfil-
ment would be inexpedient for the person to whom they are
made 3 ιε, for instance, the promise made to Phaethon in the
fable, and that made to Theseus in regard·to HippolytuS.
Again, it would have been better for Agamemnon (95) not to
sacrifice Iphigenia. Thus we sec that circumstances some-
times change the character of the action.

Of the four heads under which we treated of duty in the
first book (96) we have dwelt sufficiently on the first two; it
now remains to speak of the third and fourth.

It seemed expedient to Ulysses (XXVI. 97) to avoid going
to Troy by feigning madness‚ but it was not right. And
doubtless Regulus saw a certain expediency in remaining at
Rome instead of returning to Carthage3 but he nobly urged
in the senate that the captives should be retained, and himself
kept his promise.

“ What is the obligation,” says some one, “ of an oath
(XXVIII. 102st Do we sear the anger of thc gods? But
they would have done Regulus no greater harm than he did
to himself. Did he· sear to do wrong? But the torture was
itself a greater wrong. Again, the promise was made to an
enemy; and sometimes what is in a high degree expedient
thereby becomes right.”

But (XXIX. 104) whatever a man promises, calling God to
witness, is to be maintained, because it is just and-right to do
so. Secondly, bodily torture is not so great an cvil as wrong·
doing. Thirdly (106), a promise, made even to a recognized
enemy, must be kept according to the tenor of the language.

This is shown by several examples (XXX. 109) from our
history. And that Regulus (110) himself advocated in the
senate the retaining of the captives is the most admirable part
of his conduct. His returning to Carthage (XXXI. 111) was
