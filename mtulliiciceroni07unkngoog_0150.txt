BOOK 111. 121

in consonance with the customs of the time, as is scen from the
Twelve TableS‚ the lam, and the action of the censor-s, Note,
als0‚ the example of Τ. Manlius (112). Hannibal sent the
captives (XXXII. 113) to treat for an exchange after the bat-
tle of Cannae3 th‘ey would have done wrongly not to obey
their oath to return3 one of them, who attempted to evade
the oath‚ was rightly seut back by the senate.

The fourth point of the discussion still remains (XXXIII.
' 116), the conflict of expediency with the duty of temperance;
and here we have to contend with those philosophata, such as
the Cyrenaics and EpicuruS, who consider pleasure the highest
good. But if pleasure is the great end of life, what place is
left (117) for prudence‚ or fortitude, or temperancess Epi-
curus (118) succeedS, it is true, to some extent in finding a
sphere for these virtues; but not so for justice. But (119)
as wc have shown that there is no such thing as an expediency
which is contrary to right, so we declare that all plcasure is
contrary to right3 and the attempt to unite them is futile.

Pleasure (120) may add a charm to the right, but never can
be really expedient.
