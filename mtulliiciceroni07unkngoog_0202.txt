ΟΗΑΡΤΕΒ 1.

1 11, 1. Marce miz Marcus Cicero went to Athens in April,

nc· 45, so that he had been there a full year (annum iam)
when this treatise was begun. See Introd. δ 5.-11, 2. Cratip-
pum, an eminent Peripatetic philosopher of the time, and prob-
ably head of ‘that school at Athens. Cicero held him in the
highest esteem‚ and procured for him from Caesar the gift of the
Roman citizenship. In De Div'. 1. 8, 5 he is spoken of as famili-
aria noster, quem eqo parem summis Peripateticis iudico ,⁰ in Ti-
maeus 1. 1, 2 Peripateticorum omnium, quoe' quidem eqo audierim,
meo iudicio facile princepe. Little is known of his teaching3
bnt Cicero especially mentions a work of his on divination—
11, 5. ut lpse . . . coniunxi . . . idem tibi censeo faciendum ε
Instead of aie, corresponding to a preceding ut, we often find a
pronoun, idem, id, Ῑωσ, οι· the like. De Leg. 11. 6, 14 sed ut vir
doctissimus fecit Plato . . . idem milti endo westiwudam—11, 6.
eum Graecis Latina coniunxi: As he says in Brut. 90, 310 Gom-
mentabar declamatum . . . quotidie ,⁰ idque faciebam multum etiam
Latine, sed Graece saepius, vel quod Graeca oratio plura ornamenta
suppeditans consuetudinem similiter Latine dicendi afferebat, vel
quod a Graecia nummis doctoribus, nisi Graece dicerem, neque cor·
r-i9i possem neque doceri. -· 11, 9. utriusque orationis, i. e. both
the Latin and the Greek languages; so below (l. 20) he says,
orationem Latinam efficies kqendia nostrie pleniorem. He refers
apparently to the use of the Latin in philosophical workS, as we
see from the next sentence. Some commentatore, comparing
§ 3 illud forense dicendi et Ῑωσ quietum disputandi yemis. refer utri-
mque linquae to the oratorical and philosophical styles. The
author's meaning is not entirely clear.
