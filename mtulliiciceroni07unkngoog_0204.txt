BOOK Ι. ΟΗΑΡ. Ι. 5 1-3. 175

do rebus . . . impedio is an incidental remark, and would be
more precisely put in the form of a subordinate clause3 “ al-
though in regard to the subject-matter you are quite at liberty
to· form y'our own opinion, yet‚’' etc. This is quite common in
Cicer03 compare 5 513 ς 84; 11.§ 173 De Leg. ΙΙ. ’7, 16 neminem
esse oportere tam stulte arroqantem, ut in se rationem et mentem
putet inesse, in eaelo mundoque non putet—11, 2⁰. leg-endis 'nos-
tris repeats nostra leqem (l. 17), because the attention has been
somewhat distr-acted since the beginning of the sentence. .

12, 1. Nam philosophandi etc.: The logical arrangement of
the thought would be thus: “ While yielding the palm to many
in philosophie discussion, 1 think 1 have a right to claim for
myself the especial excellences of the orator, for to that 1 have
devoted my life.” This order is changed for the purpose of
bringing into contrast the philosophandi seoe‘entiam with quod est
oratorie proprium. Macrobius (in Somn. Scip.) says of Cicero:
Tullius nullius sectae insciusmeteribm probatae. .

12, 2. apte, dlstlncte, ornate= De Orat. 111. 14, 53 qui dis·
tincto, qui explicate, qui abundanter, qui illuminate et rebiw'et verbis
dieunt . . . ii sunt qai, dicunt ornate ,·' qui idem ita moderantur, ut
rerum, ut personarum divnitatesferunt, ii sunt in eo venere laudan-
di, quod eqo-aptum et congruens nomino. distincte means “ clearly‚”
in arrangement of matter as well as choice of expression.

3 12, 11. elaboraret: laborare denotes'“ to labor,” “to suffer
anxiety,’' “to be in trouble ;’' elaborare implies succeSS, or refers
to the definite aim of the work. sequeretur, “ attempted‚” as
opposed to oomequi, “ to attain to.” So in De Nat. I. 5, 12 Cuius
rei tantae tamque dffeilio facultatem consecutum esse me non pro-
fiteor, secatum esse prae mosera—12, 18. disputandi: disputare
is not the· same as our ‘⁴ dispute;” it denotes particularly philo·
sophie discussion, opposed here to dicere, forensic discourse.—
DemetrIus PhalerouS, born about nc, 345, was made governor
of Athens by Cassander from nc, 817 to 3073 but when Deme-
trius Poliorketes came there he fled to Ptolemaeus PhiladelphuS,
in Egypt, and died in 283. He was rather a statesman and orator
than a philosopher. Brut. 9, 37 Phalereus . . . succeseit . . . eruditio·
simus ille quidem, sed non tam armis institutus quam palaestra, ita·
que delectabat maqie Athenienses quam inflammabat. Processerat
enim in solem et pulverem non ut e militari tabernaculo, sed ut e Theo-

phrasti doctissimi hominis umbracula—12, 15. Theophrastl, the
disciple and successor of Aristotle. Brut. 31, 121 quis Aristotele
