CHAPTER ΙΙ.

12, 25. Sed, “But‚” to come more directly to the subject in
hand-.--12, 26. multa posthae: This, with the intimation at the
end of the treatise, shows that Cicero intended to write stili more
upon these subJect-s. -- 12, 27. auotoritas is anything in the
character or condition of a person which gives weight to what
he sayS.

12, 29. accurate is not so much “ precisely,” as “ carefully‚”
maqna cum curm—latissime patere, ‘⁴ to have the widestapplica-
tion ;'’ so below VII. 203 ᾗ 24 end; ᾗ 26, and often elsewhere.—
12, 30. ea quae . . . tradita . . . praecepta sunt: A sort of hen-
diadyS, “ the teachings which have been handed down.” Comp.
p. 13, 5 ‘nullis officii praeceptis tradendus.

12, 81. neque publicis neque privatis etc.= The same se·
quence is found in Ep. ad Fam. V. 8, 5 end3 Ep. ad Att. 1. 17, 6
uon forenses res, uon domesticae, ‘nou publicae, non' privatae carere
diutius tuo suavissimo atque amantissimo consilio ac sermone pos-

sunt.—13, 1. si tecum agas quid, “if you deal with what con-
cerns yourself alone.'’

6 13, 5. nullis officii praeceptis tradendis, “if he does not
givc,” or “without giving some instruction in regard to duty.”
The ablative of the gerund or gerundive is osten thus used to
indicate the circumstances accompanying the action of the verb
of the sentence. Verg. Aen. H. 6 Quia talia fando 1 temperet a
lacrimis, i. e. dum satur! Ep. ad Att. IV. 1, 6 eum continuo . . .
plausum meo nomine recitando' dedissent, i. e. while my name was
read, or at the reading of my name. See Niigelsbach‚ Latcin.
Stylistik‚ ed. 3, p. 100.

18, 7. bonorum et malorum fluibus: In this phrase finis
denotes “the highest point‚” “the greatest degree ;'’ and it is
used by Cicer0, with other expressions such as extremum, ulti-

mum, summum, to translate the Greek τέλος. Bonorum finis or .

τέλος is “the highest good,” that which is to be desired for its
own sake without reference to anything else, and to which all
our actions are to be directed as a standard of right. · Stob. Ecl.
Eth. p.'278‚ Heer. λεκτέον τέλος εἶναι οὗ χάριν πάντα πράττομεν,
αὐτὸ δὲ οὐδενός. The force of Sed at the beginning of the sen-
tence is seen by referring to l. 18 Hae discipliuae etc. Having
