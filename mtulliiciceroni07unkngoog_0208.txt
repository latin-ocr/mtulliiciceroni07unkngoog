ita est quoddam commune officium sapientis et ineipien tia—13, 24.
Aristonis: Aristo of chios, a disciple of Zen0‚ differed very
much from his teacher. He considered ethics the only impor-
tant part of philosophy, and limited very considerably its do-
main. He held that the root of all the virtues was health, or,
according to Galen, the knowledge of good and evil, meaning
probably a sound moral judgment3 but by denying all differ·
ences between the ἀδιάφορα, and contending that nothing was
of any value but absolute good, he lest no room for practical

⁰ morality, or, as Cicero sayS, no dilectum rerum. Plut. virt. Mor.

2 Ἀρίστων δὲ ὁ Χῖος τῇ μὲν οὐσίᾳ μίαν καὶ αὐτὸς ἀρετὴν ἐποίει καὶ
ὖγείαν.’ὦνόμαζε; Galen. Hippocr. et Plat. V. 5, Schl. S. 468 κάλ-
λιον. οὖν Ἀρίστων ὁ Χῖος, οὔτε πολλὰς εἶναι τὰς α’ρετὰς τῆς ψυχῆς
ἀποφηνάμενος, ἀλλὰ μίαν, ἣν ἐπιστήμην ἀγαθῶν τε καὶ, κακῶν εἶναί
‹finem—Pyrrhonis: Pyrrhe, a nat-ive of Elis, was contempora-ry
with Alexander the Great. He was a eceptio, and held that we
can know nothing of the constitution of thingS, that, therefore,
we can form no trustworth y opinions about them, and that the
result of this mental attitude will always: be that tranquil·
lity, ἀταραξία, which leads to happiness, Right and wrong are
therefore, according to him, matters of law. and custom. Diog.
Laert. IX. 61 οὐδὲν γὰρ ἔφασκεν οὔτε ’καλὸν οὔτε αῖσχρὸν οὔτε δίκαιον
οὔτε ἄδικον, καὶ ὁμοίως ἐπὶ πάντων, μηδὲν εἶναι τῇ ἀληθείᾳ, νόμῳ δὲ
καὶ ἔθει πάντα τοὺς ἀνθρώπους πράττειν, οὗ γὰρ μᾶλλον τόδε ἢ τόδε
εἶναι ἕκαστον. Sext. Emp. Math. XI. 140 οὕτε ἀγαθόν τι ἔστι φύσει
οὔτε κακόν, ἀλλὰ πρὸς ἀνθρώπων ταῦτα νόῳ κέκριται κατὰ τὸν Τίμωνα.
-ΕνίΠίε Erillus of Carthage, also a pnpil of Zen0, taught that
knowledge was the highest good, scientiam summum bonum esse
neo rem ullam aliam per se Qetendam (De Fin. V. 25, ¹73); ancl
Diog. Laert. VII. 1653 but he taught also that among the ἀδιά-
φορα many things were desirabl'e which he termed ὑποτελίδα,
. and these seem to have been substantially the-same as the προηγ-
μένα of the other Stoics3 so that his divergence from pure Stoi-
cism was not very great. He'held διαφέρειν τέλος καὶ ὑποτελίδα.
τῆς μὲν γὰρ καὶ τοὺς μὴ σοφοὺς στοχάζεσθαι, τοῦ δὲ μόνον τὸν σοφόν;
that is, that the τέλος, οι· highest aim, ἐπιστήμη, is only such sor
the sapiam, the ὖποτελίς is ,such for the common man. On Eril-
