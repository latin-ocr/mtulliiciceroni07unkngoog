BOOK Ι. ΟΗΑΙ). ΙΙ, ΠΙ. 5 6, ’7. 181

'uiue it is strange that the author should not have referred to it
in III. 3, 14, where he discusses the same division of duties3
second, that 5 9 is closely connected with 5 ’ἲς third, that the
whole section is a confused summary of III. 3, 14 or of De Fin.
ΙΙΙ. 17, 58; and that it is absurd to suppose that Cicero would
have written so vaguely even when most careless.

Of course, if the section is cancelled, there is no definition of
the subject-matter of the book, and we are tempted to assume
that something has been lost, probably aster disputetur ,· and
this is one objection against cancelling it, for some definition is
necessary. Then the third book shows in many parts evidences
of the greatest haste; the author may have written the part in
question (III. 3, 14) without recalling what he had written in
the first book3 moreover the absence of any mention in book
third might be objected as well to the definition which is sup-
posed to have been lost aster disputata-7²⁰. Further, the beginning
of 5 9, Triplex iqitur eet, ut Panaetio videtur, sounds very much
as if Cicero had just been consulting, or had in mind, some other
authority for the definition of duty, and then with mitur, 1. 22,
recurred to his especial subject, took up Panaetius again, men-
tioning him by name, and giving his threefold division.' This
would explain the connection with 5 7.

The passage is certainly vague and awkward3 but there are
many carelessly written passages in the book, and we are in-
clined to consider it genuine, with-the exception, perhapS, of
Atque etiam alia divisio est 0.ffi⁶2⁰i at the beginning of 5 83 the def·
inition, however, seems to have been taken from some other au-
thor than Panaetius.

14, 6. finem bonorum: See note on p. 13‚¹7. The first por·

tion of ethics, Cicero says, treats of the standard of right and „

wrong, which had already been fully discussed in the De Finibus.
—alterum, quod positum est in praeceptis is the παραινετικῆ, the
portion of ethics giving practical rules of conduct. Some of the
Stoice gave no‘ attention to this3 Aristo even declared that it was
utterly useless, that sound common-sense, fortified by knowledge ,,
and right'intentionS, was sufficient. But after the time of Chry·
sippus the practical side was-brought into greater prominence‚
and was gradually developed into a system of casuistry.-
