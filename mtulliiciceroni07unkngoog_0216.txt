here is not clear, but the sense of the sectionis: The remaining
three virtues are exercised iu the actions of common life3 while
the first, sapientia, deals with speculative truth. For the divis-
ion of the virtues into theoretical· and practical, attributed to
PanaetiuS, see Introd. ς 29. In Partit. Orat. 22, 76 Cicero lays
down· the same division: Est iqitur vis virtutis dupleoe,· aut enim

§ 153 of this book Cicero recognizes this distinction, translating
σοφία by sapientia, and φρόνησις by prudentia, or ‘rmum eapeten-
