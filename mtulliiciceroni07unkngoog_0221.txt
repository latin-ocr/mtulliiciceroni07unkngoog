aut salutem. Cicero holds that duty to one's country takes
precedence of all others—20, 3. defendit, scil. iniuriam—20,
4. est ln vitio, “is in fault ;'’ corresponding exactly in this in-
stance to our English expression. But the Latin says in laude
ease, “to be praiseworthyss’ so c. 14, ἱ 42 in. eadem sunt iniust-i-
tia; 15, 47 est in ρῄῖσὶο.
24 20, 5. illae quldem iniuriae, the former of the classes men·
tioned in the preceding sentence. These are osten (saepe) in-
. flicted, he says, to prevent some one else from rujuring us3 but
(Maoeimam partem) in the greatest number of cases the object is
to gratify our desires.

20, 8. Maximam partem = maoeima eoe parte, an extension to
the common language of the Greek construction—20, 9. adgre-
diuntur, sc. homines—20, 11. vitio must here mean those forms
of wrong-doing just mentioned, namely ut edwi-scantur etc.

CHAPTER VIII.

25 20, 12. The unjust pursuit of riches ancl power. Expetuntur
autem divitiae: Some commentators find here a fourfold division
of the reasons for the pursuit of wealth 3 ad usus vitae metuar-ios ,·
ad perfruendas voluptates ,· ad opes et ad qratffloandi facultatem ,-
Dekotoent etioem maqmfioe‘ appan-atta etc. But the division seems
rather twofold—into the necessities and the luxuries of life3
only, says Cicero, these are very different for different persons.
Men of greater ambition seek money to gain. influence and
attach others to their interests3 Crassus, for example, found it
impossible to get on without enough· to support an army.

20, 14. pecuniae denotes property in general, not coined
money alone—20, 15. opes is influence, gratificandi facultatem
is the ability to do favore, here especially pecuniary favors, to
distribute largesseS, etc. '- nuper, 44 lately,” at least ten years
before, because Crassus fell in the year of the city 701, fight—
ing a'gainst the Parthians. But its meaning varies according to
the connection3 in De Nat. Deor. ΙΙ. 50,126 nuper, ul est paucis
