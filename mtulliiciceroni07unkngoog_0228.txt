Auctoritas, as applied, topi-operty, is equivalent to the legal own-
ership. This clause from the twelve tables provided that no ad-

vested in him any right of property, as it would have done in a
civis. So under the same circumstances the owner of a thing
stolen or taken by violence never lost the auctor itas, even though .
the actual possessor had obtained it bona fide. Gaius, Inst. ΙΙ.

⁶ an enemy? ” This explanation of¹ the matter is without doubt

more correct than Cicero'S. Whatever virtues the Romans may
have had, mansuetudo was not one of them.
