CHAPTER XIV.

a new division of his subjectu—de beneficentia ae de liberali-
tate: The repetition of the proposit-ion would seem to indicate
two different ideas; hut the relative qua and the singular habet
show that the writer has only α’ single one in mind. Etymologi-
eally, beneficentia is the doing good, liberalitas isthe being free,
open—handed—two sides of the same action3 but Cicero seems to
nse the words indiseriminately in other passages—27, 17. qni-
