218 Nonas.

this the first part of our sentence correspondet we should risk
our own rather than the public interests. In Itemque alii de vita,
etc„ he says men have to hazard their lives, their fame, and the
good-will of their fellow-citizens. To this corresponds the sec-
ond part of our sentence: we should hazard our honor, our fame,
more willingly than cetera commoda, i. e. our property, ‚our lives
etc. He goes on in the next section to illustrat-e this by saying
that many have been ready enough to lavish their money ,or their
lives (cetera commoda), and still would ‚not make. the least sacti-
fice of their reputations. Cicero is thinking of his own case3 he
doubtless felt that he had sacrificed his own glory for his coun-
try; he had not taken the part in public affairs which he felt
himself entitled to take3 and the failure was very bitter to one
so eager for personal distinction.

42, 2. iacturam tacere was said of throwing overboard cargo

to lightcn a vesselz here, to give up with no prospect of advan-
tage—42, 8. Callicratidas commanded the fleet of the Lacedae-
monians at the battle of Arginusae in 13.c. 406. He had con-
quered Conon at Mitylene, taken Lesbos and other islands (multa
fecisset cot-eyia), and before this battle was advised of the rein-
forcements of the Atheniens and wamed not to risk meeting
them. Cicero blames him for not sacrificing his personal repu-
tation to the interest of the ,state and so ,avoiding the battle3
and the answer, as he reports it, seems to justify the criticism.
But according to other accounts a soothsayer had told him that
the fleet would be victorious, though the commander would lose
his life3 and Xenophon, Hellen. L 6, 32, gives his answert Καλ-
λικρατίδας δὲ εἶπεν, ὅτι ἦ Σπάρτη οὐδὲν κακίον οἰκεῖται αὐτοῦ ἀπο-
θανόντος, φεύγειν δὲ αἰσχρὸν εἶναι ἔφη. This places the matter
in a very different light—42, ὅ. vertit . . . omnia, “overturned
everything‚’' thrcw away all he had gained. ' ·

42, 12. Cleombrotus commanded the Lacedaemonians at the
battle of Leuctra, 13.c. 371. According to Xen. Hellen. VI. 4,
5 he feared a comparison with Agesilaus, and the suspicion of
being in collusion with the Thebans·
