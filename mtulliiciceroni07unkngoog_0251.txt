Stob. Ecl. Eth. 11.. p. 106, included under this head εὓπιξία, κοσ-
μιότης, cidanea-{mh ἐγκράτειας according to Diog. Laert- VII. 126
κοσμιότης and εὐταξία. Panaetius and Cicero follow the latter
division, including under κού-μόνης verecundia· and· pulchritudo.

opinions of otherS. ,Βο in De Rep. V. 4, 6 he speaks of verecun-

describes rather than defines what is to be understood by the
term decorum, Gr. apin-ov. It may be taken, he saw, in a general
and 'in a special sense. In the general sense it is coextensive
with honestum ,· for nothing can be honestum whichis not at the
