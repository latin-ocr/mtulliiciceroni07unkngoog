· phere since Plat03 comp. Phaedr. p. 246 B. - 48, 2⁷. sintque
tranquilli atquo omni anlml perturbatlone careant can hardly
b'e said of the appetites, as they are a part of the animun and
doubtless for this reason animi is bracketed by Facciolati, Geru-

hard, and liciae, and omitted by Beier; otherwise we must as· . ·.

sume that the writer loses sight of the original subject, and has
in mind homines or something similar. In that case we may
compare this with the preceding sentence aetio cacare debet . . .
nec voro avere etc. The whole passage is very carelessly written.

49, 2. perturbantur . . . corpora: It is hardly necessary to

' assume a zeugma here for corpora detorquentur. The normal
condition of the body can be said pm·turbao·i; and the manner
in which this takes place' is described m the next sentence.

103 49, 7. officii romam is‘ ‘the nature of duty;” but in ς 15

49, 28. Quo genere: As examples of elegant and refincd wit
Cicero cites Plautus, the old Attic comedy, and the writings of
the Socratic philosophem. How these three things came togeth-
,er in his mind it is not very easy to see. Heine remarks that
Plautus and the‘ Attic comedy are only mentioned casuany.
Hirzel (Unters. etc. p. 369) thinks that PanaetiuS, whom 'Cicero
copies, was speaking of the old Attic comedy and the Socratic

dialogues together in respect of the purity of the language and 5 .. j

the earnest moral tone common to both; ‚that Cicero hastily ’
