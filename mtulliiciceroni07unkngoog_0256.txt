may be seen from Brut. 85, 292 qu ironiam illam, qnam *in Socrate ’
dicuntsuicse, qua ille in Platonis et Xenophontis et Aeschini libris
utitur, facetam et eleqantem puto. Cato had collected and pub-
lished under the title of ἀποφθέγματα a number of pointed and
witty sayings.

· 49, 82. ut ne nimis omnia profundamus, “that we may not
push everything to excess;” as above ς 103 he says oenus iocandi

non profusum. The commentatore differ as to the meaning of . ζ

omnia. Ernesti defines it as ‘⁴ risum, clamorem, mortum corporis,·'’
Gemhard‚ “ omnia ludorum ymera;” Zumpt explains “m totos
noc quasi effundamus laetitia ;” Beier, “sutili-asima vel ineptissima
quaeque ;’‘ Heine, “ our personal dignity and position.” The idea
depende of course upon the meaning we give to profundamus.

carried away by a power which 'we cannot resist3 duci that of

50, 12. sed si quis paulo erectior: The commentatore differ
in explaining this passage. Some, with Zumpt, saythat eod re·
sumes the thread of the sentence broken by the parenthesis, and
that erectior is ‘only a repetition of ad voluptates propensior. Oth-
ers, as Heine for example, take erectim· in- the sense of “more
high-toned;” and this seems preferable. The sentence is then z
‘⁴ If a person is more than ordinarily disposed to sensual pleasure
(provided he be not, as some men are, quite on a level with the
brutes), but if he be a little inclined to higher thingS, although
he may be attracted by pleasure, yet he conceals and dissimu-
lates ” etc. sed . . . erectior then does not resume the thread of
the sentence, but is simply opposed to modo . . . venere, with a
change of construction which is common in the easy style of
this treatise.
