etc.: Epiqom' was the title of a tragedy of Attius. The tole of
Alcmaeon was perhaps the one chosen for the reason which
Cicero assigns. The Clytemestra (1.2o) was by the same author.
Medus was the title of a tragedy of Pacuvius. Medus was the
,son of Medea, who came to Colchis, and would have been killed
there; but he was saved by his mother, and finally became heir
of his grandfather Aeetes, Metanippa was freed from prison by
her sonsBocotus and Aeolus, and received her eyesight from ,-
Neptune, of which she had been deprived by her father. The
play was by Ennius, as also the Aiax, mentioned here. The
Antiopa (l. 21) was by Pacuvius. Antiopa was defended by her
sons, Amphion and Zethus, against their uncle Lycus and his
wife Dirce. Of the actor-s here mentioned, Rupilius is quite un-
known; Aesopus was the friend of Cicero, and, exceptingRos-
ciuS, the most celebrated actor of his time3 see De Div. 1. 87, 8ος

authority of the MSS. in this and to some extent in other pas-
sages of Cicer03 it was adopted by Muller and Heine in their

editions, and is given as the correct one in Brambach (Aids to .„ j

Latin Orthography, p. 63).
