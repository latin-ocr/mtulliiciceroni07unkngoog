in c. 40 ff„ of ordo ramme-58, 1. formositate (forma) denotes
the benuty of a thing in genera13 ordine, the harmony of sll the
parts among themselves and -with outward circumstance33 or-
natu, ans-thing external which heightens the effect of these.
The protasis of the sentence is quoniam . . . vivamus, the spodosis
hie . . . dicantur (1.4).—58‚ 4. quibuscum denotes nn intimate
personal relation, the living together under the same roof, for
instance3 apud quos an externat one, such as that of &How-citi-
zens or fellow-countrymen.

58, ⁷. formam . . . figuram It is difficult to distinguish these
in general us'age3 but here, and in 5 130 Formae dimitat eoloris
bonitate tuenda eet, forma is evidently used for thefsce ns distin-
guished from fiqura, the whole shape. ln qun esset etc. restricts
the expression reliqua fiqura to so much ‚of the person as‘ might
have a species honesta ,· hence the subjunctive.

127 58, 12. imitata est, ‘⁶ has followed the guidunce σθ’-τοτο-
cundia, αι’δημοσῦνη. The Stoice, Stob. Ecl. Eth. 11. p. 106, define
it us ἐπιστήμη ἐὐλαβητικὴ ὀρθοῦ ψόγους see also note on p. 45, 2¹7.
But Cicero does not discuss this part of verecundia ; he adopts
the Stoic division, but follows his own train of thought. Com-
pare with this section De Nat. Deor. 11. 56,141.

128 58, 21. Stoici paene cynieiz The coerseness of the Gynic
Diogenes and his sect was proverbial. Zeno, the first of the
StoicS, though starting from the Cynic doctrine, did not adopt
nll their disregard of the proprieties of life; as Diog. Lnert. VII.
3 sayS, ἐντεῦθεν ἤκουσε τοῦ Κράτητος, ὣλως μὲν εὔτονος πρὸς
φιλοσοφίαν. αἰδήμων δὲ ὥς πρὸς τὴν κυνικὴν ἀναισχυντίαν. But
not all the Stoice followed him in this respect. Cic. de Fin. 111.
20, 68 Cynicorum rationem atque vitam alii (Stoici) cadere in ea-
pientem dicunt, alii nullo modo, Diog. Laert. VII. 121 says irv-
νιεῖν τε αὐτὸν (τὸν σοφόν φασι)· εἶναι γὰρ τὸν κυνισμὸν σύντομον
ἐπ’ aper-»¹79 ὁδόν.

58, 30. accubitio, that is, at meals. ·

129 5⁹, 1. Nee vero histrionibus oratoribusque eoncedendum
ost, etc.: “Nor, indeed, is this to be allowed to actors and ora-
tors, that these matters be properly regulated 1n their case, while
they are neglected by uS.” apta is to be taken in the same sense
as when it is applied to ἀίουσαι-θος and dissoluta as in Ep. ad Att.
Ι. 19. 8, nihil asperum . . . neo tamen quicquam populare ao dim·
lutum ,· and Pro Flac. 9, dissoluta consuetudo Graecorum. Mr.
Holden translates: ‘⁴ Nor are we to admit that, however proper
