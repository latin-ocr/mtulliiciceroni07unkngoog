metry of character-3 and σωφροσύνη is defined, too, as εὐαρμοστία
καὶ εὐταξία ψυχῆς πρὸς τὰς κατὰ φύσιν ἡδονὰς καὶ λύπαςς and εὐταξία
sometimes corresponds to moderatio in general. The division
would have been clearer if Cicero had used ordo or opportunitas
for εὐταξία in the limited sense which he here discussesg instead
of that he uses the general term modestia—64, 2. hanc: We should
expect hae, referring to seientia eontinentur ea, but it is attracted
to the case of modestiam. -64, 4. illa ost. As in l. 2 we have
hane for hac, referring to scientia, so here we should expect the
ablative illa, in qua. So Cicero often varies the expression in a
series or a paralle13 § 18 unam. ‚alterum ειη· see also note on
p. 63, 26.

64, 8. eonoeaflonis sums up the preceding definition scientia
. . . collocandarum in one word, to compare it with that of orde,
which he proceeds to give. So inlocum (l. 10) he sums up the pre-
ceding definition of ordo, as applied to an'action, identifies that
with opportunitas temporis, and both with· the Greek sinapio:
Lat. occasio. The last, however, includes an idea of chance, which
the Greek εὐκαιρία does not convey. So that modestia m this nar-

row sense is distinguished from modestia in the wider sense, when
used as equivalent to temperantia.

of modestia, he says, -might be applied also to prudentia, the first
of the four cardinal virtues, of which he has treated principio,
namely, in c. 63 but in the present instance he considers mdeetia
only in the narrow sense, as a part of ‘moderatio and temperantia.
—prudenflaoz φρόνησις is ἐπιστήμη ὧν ποιητέον καὶ οὐ ποιητέονς
a part of this is εὐβουλία, or ἐπιστήμη τοῦ ποῖα καὶ πῶς πράττοντες

· stances for doing anything is a. part of prudentia so far as we are
guided by moral considerationS, but of modestia, εὐταξία, so far as
ext-emal propriety and regard for other persons decide the mat-
ter. The latter considerations he speaks of asthose quae perti·-

when we were discussing it in c. 6. But in fact this point was
