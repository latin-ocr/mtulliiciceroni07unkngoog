hilaritas remissis (superciliis) mauditum—65, 28. quid eorum,
scil. quaestum. Mr. Holden translates “which of our actions is
proper ;” i. e. the expressions of face, etc„ which we observe in
others, will guide us in judging of our own conduct-65, 24.
officio in this connection is the same as decoro,

65, 27. ut magis in aliis cernamus· Seu. De Ira, c. 28Aliena
vitia in oculis habmus, a ten-90 nostra sunt.

14⁰1 65, 30. ad ea eligenda is taken by Heine and others as a
careless expression for ad eliqemlum a iis. -65, 81. adhibere,
scil. in consilium. .

66, 1. Maior enim pars etc„ “For the greater part of man-
kind generally follow where nature herself leads,‘' that ia, in
judqinq of what is becoming. Their conduct may not of course
always be right3 but their moral judqmeuts may be'relied upon,
'if we are careful to ascertain what they really are. The illustra-

·tion drawn from the* practice of the artists (l. 5) and the whole
context show tha't this is theright interpretation. So Arist. Eth.
Nic. X. 2 ἁ γὰρ πᾶσι δοκεῖ, ταῦτ’ εἶναι φαμέν,· ὁ δ’ ἀναιρῶν ταύτην
τὴν πίστιν οὗ πάνυ πιστότερα ἐρεῖ. But the next sentence gives
the important qualification, that we must notice not only what a
person says, but what he thinks, and the reasons for his opinion. .
The passage has been very much misunderstood.

Nat. XXXV, 10, 36, says idem perfecta opera proponebat in pomula

148 66, 11. agentum The future, contemplating cases that will
happen. So below qui mayiebratum habebunt—66, 14. Socrates
had many habits that were eontra morem consuetudinemque civi-
lem. He wore no shoes, remained standing for honrs on the
street absorbed in meditation, and at home was not ashamed to
dance alone. Xen. Symp. 2, 17 ff. aut has no disjunctive force
here. De Or. ΙΙ. 4, 16 ut no Suspiciuo,familiaric meus, aut Cotta
plus quam o'qo apud to valera videantur. · Aristippus was head
of· the Cyrenaic school, so called from his birthplace, Cyrene3 he
held that pleasnre was the highest good. Cicero speaks of him
in De Fin. 11.· 6, 18; Π. 40; Ι. 23, 26; and below, 111. 33, 116; but
never with approval as here; which only shows that he is fol-
lowing Panaetius. See Diog..Laert. 11. ,66 ff.; Hor. Ep. Ι. 17, 23
omnis Aristippum decuit color et status et reo.
