but simply from his own observation3 the remarks on this head
are drawn from Roman life.

67, 1. portitorum: The publicani were a class of men, osten
of the equestrian order, who contracted with the state for the
collection of 'the taxes from particular districts3 to their calling
no reproach was attached. But the portitores were those whom
they employed for the actual collection of the taxes3 and they
were universally detested. — faeneratorum, money · lenders by

Cicero speaks -only of such quorum operae, whose simple labor,

ing degrading, says Cicem, inhonestum, for those whose rank
permits them to engage in them. A man of senatorial or eques-
trian rank could not do so; but, as he shows in §19, they might
