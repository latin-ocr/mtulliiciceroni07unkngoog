thing probably depended upon the scale on which it was con-
ducted. When it was maana et copiosa, it was not admodum
vituperanda ,· and, when a man withdrew with a large fortune,
invested in lauded property and became a large farmer, videtur

CHAPTER XLIII.

152 67, 28. In this and the remaining.chapters of the first book
-cicero treats of the conflict of two hortata. He says that the
point was not touched upon by Panaetius; and, if we may
judge from a remark in § 159, he made some use of Posidonius
in what he says upon it. This, however, amounts to very little,
namely, that duties flowing from iustitia take precedence of .

those from sapientia, and also of those from fortitudo, but not ·

always of those flowing from moderatio. The demonstration is
not very clear, and the argument is intel-rupted by extraneous
matter.

68, 2. partibus quattuor, i. e. the four virtues, which he here'
designates by different πώεα-68, 4. haec is a feminine form
occasionally found in Oicem, and refers to partes.

who gave the preference to the theoretical over the practical life.

coming under the head of justice, those which we owe to our
fellow-men.—68, 7. cognitione, or sapientia—The argument
here used is also found, to prove that mankind cannot live in
solitude, in De Am. 23, 87; De Fin. ΠΙ. 20, 65; V. 20, 57.

68, 12. Princepsque omnium vii-tntum etc. When treating
of the first virtue in § 18, as was then noticed, Cicero ignored the
distinction here made between σοφία, or ἐπιστήμη, τῶν θείων καὶ
