248 . NOTES.

ἆνθρωπείων, the 'common foundation of all the virtues, and φρό-
νησις, wisdom in the narrower sense, as applied to the ,practical
concerns of life, rerum expetendarum fugiendarumque xiaztia.
See also the definition in 11. 2, 5. The distinction was as old as J

the time of Chrysippus. In 5 20 Cicero derives justice from the
interdependence of men living in society; here from the door-um et
hominum 'communitas et societas inter ipsos. So the Stoics frequent-
ly did; Sext. Emp. adv. Math. IX. 1313 De Fin. 111. 19, 64. In 5
160, below, the duties towards God are put first, though he has not
mentioned them before. The construction is here very confused.
The sentence would naturally run somewhat as follows: Sapientia
porro deorum et hominum communitatem et societatem inter ipsos
eontiri'et ,· cumque princeps omnium virtutum sit, memo est, qnod a ,
communitate dueatur (fficium, id esu maximum. After sapientia
he inserts a definition and distinction quam σοφίαν. . . scientia,
resumes the sentence with illa autem sapientia, throws the main '<
thought into a relative sentence in qua . . . inter ipsos, and recalls
the idea princeps omnium virtutum in the condition si oa maa-ima
est, to 'draw the conclusion nece-m est etc.

68, 28. consequatur: aequatur, as in 5 116.
15⁴ 68, 27. re ipsu, i. e. in action.

68, 28. cummim, “very ardent,’' intently occupied. For the
construction after cupidus comp. De Rep. Ι. 8, 13 in disset-mdo
rudem De Inv. 11. 10, 33 qui in illa re turpia aut cupidus aut
petulans suit—(58, 29. si . . . slt allatum periculum, i. e. “if
the news of danger were brought.’' —— 69, 2. hoc idem . . . fece· .
rit: idem is nominative. ¹
155 69, 5. ad hominum utilitatem = ad communem utilitatem, the

chief end of justice. So Ι. 20 in hoo naturam debemus ducem
sequi, communes utilitates in medium afferre. See note on p. 66,

27. -69, 6. antiquins (anto), nothing should come before it, be
of greater importance.

CHAPTER XLIV.

69, 11. Lysis, of Tarentum, is said to have written on Py-
thagoras and his doctrines—Syracosium, the Greek form, not
uncommon also in Latin. Dionem, the uncle of the younger
Dionysius, whom he 'afterwards overthrew. He was at first a
Pythagoream but when Plato came to Syracuse in no. 389, he
became one of his followers and so remained until his death in
20. 353.— 69, 13. a doctoribus . . . instructi: Cicero osten ex-
