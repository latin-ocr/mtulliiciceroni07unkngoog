256 NOTES.

alluded to are the Peripatetics who considered to be bona and
utilia many things which were not necessarily honesta.- The
train of thought is naturally continued in Quod qui etc. (l. 17),
and most of the commentators consider the next sentence Quie-
quid . . . eit utile as an interpolation—The expression haee ma
venera (l. 14) is the point upon which the commentators differ.
Heine under-stands it to refer to: 1. The absolute honest-mn, which
is at the same time atim 2. The honestum quod non esset utile ,-
3. The utile quod non esset honestum.. But there was no previous
mention of two honesta ,· and although Cicero makes-a distinc-

, tion in ΙΙΙ. § 17 between the vere honestum and that q‘uod eommu-
πίων appellamus honestum, yet that distinction is not in point
for our passage. Other commentators refer the tria ymera to
the honestum, iustum, and utile of the following sentence. But
,there is really no difference between the first two so far as con-
cerus this passage. The two sorts of utelw are repeatedly referred
to in the third book, the real utile, and id quod utile videtur.-

erqo resumes the discussion, which was interrupted by the digres-
sion in regard to the popular use of the term utile (l. 8). The
utile comes to us from all external objects; but it is only in rela-
tion to the ratione utenbelbue (l. 28) that we exercise any duties.
They are the Gods and men. The Gods. are satisfied by pietas

and sanctitas ,· and the whole subject of duty under the head of ‘

the utile is therefore mainly restricted to the treatment of our
fellow-men so as to make them useful to us, and to prevent their
doing us injury.—82, 25. ea, quae gignuntur o terra: We
should say “ plants‚’' but the Romans had no word exactly cor-
responding.
