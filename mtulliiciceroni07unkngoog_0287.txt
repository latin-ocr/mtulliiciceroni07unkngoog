253 Α NOTES.

84, 29. Dicaearchi: He was of Messina, in Sicily, a pupil of
Aristotle, acquired great fame by his geographie and historical
writings, as well as by those on philosophy; but he seems not to
have followed the system of Aristotle in all points. Among his·
numerous writings were Βίος τῆς Ἑλλάδος, an account of the
geography, politices, manners and customs of Greece, in three
books3 and Γῆς περίοδος. The philosophical works were appar·
ently written in the form of dialogue, and· were popular in style.
So the Κορινθιακοί and Λεσβιακοί mentioned in Tusc. Disp. Ι. 10,
21 and 31, 77.- 84, 30. copiosi, “ rich in language ;” so also De
Orat. ΙΙ. 53, 214 multa et varia ot eopiosa orati0.— 84, 31. ceteris
causis eluvionls; “the other causes, namely‚ inundations '’ etc.
The genitive specifice the contents of the generic word σαπείη as

' virtus continentiae, the virtue of sels-control, voa voluptatis, the
word ‘⁴ pleasure.’'— vastitatis, sterility, i. e. of places where men
might belwandering, for instance, the army of Alexander per-
ished in Gedrosia, that of Cambyses in Aethiopia. Prov. Cous·
3, 5 milites populi Romani . . . incuria, fame, morbo, vastitate eon-
eumpti. Comp. De Nat. Deor. ΙΙ. 5, 14. beluarum, not only
wild beasts, but mice, scorpione, serpente, locuste, and such like.
-- 85, 1. quaedam genera = quaedam qentes.— deinde com-
paratz The natural expression would . have been caueae colligit,
deinde omnparat ,· deinde emphasizes somewhat the connection of
the participle collectis and the verb.-— 85, 3. omni . . . calami-
tate: See note on p. 27, 12.

17 85, 8. ltaque: The passage quae . . . operosis is co-ordinate
with hominum . . . excitantur as it stende, but in sense it is sub-
ordinate3 “And so, whereas the mechanic arts give us the utili-
ties derived from inanimate things and from beastS, the services
of men are gained '' etc. So Ι. 1, 2 de rebus ipsis utere tuo iu-
dicio, i. e. however you may follow your own judgment in the
matter, yet ete.; see the note on that passage.- 85, 10. artibus
operosis, “the mechanic arts‚'’ as opposed to artes liberale⁸; to
these correspond in the latter part of the sentence sapientia et
virtute. The text here is very uncertain. Heine, aster Madvig,
reads morum praestantia [sapientia] et virtute ,⁶ Baiter 11. reads
as in our text, omitting the brackets, ,

18 85, 13. Etenim virtus omnis: The division of virtus given in
this section does not-correspond with that laid down in § 15, or
even with th at into the theoretical and practical virtueS, attributed
to Panaetius, mentioned in ᾗῇ 16, 17. It corresponds more near·
