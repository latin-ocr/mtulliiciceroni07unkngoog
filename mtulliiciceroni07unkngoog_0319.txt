confounded with Antipater of Tarsus, mentioned m ΙΙΙ. 12, 51. --
118, 18. quas res- 0prneferlt88. The discussion of the utile
has been confi'ned to the means of acquiring the favor of one ’s
fellow-men with a view to success in life. We know, of course,
nothing as to whether Panaetius himself restricted it -in this
mannen but the counsels which Cicero adds do not fairly come
within the domain of ethice. His remarks on the care 01· health
are practical only, he says nothing of the duty; and the manage-
ment of property he rightly thinks would be better taught by
the bankers than by the philosophers.

118, 19. Sed: The force of this is: “But not to pass these
over ιιι silence Iwiu say that'’ etc .--118‚ 20. sul eorporis: See

“ 118, 82. vellem: The tense expresses a wish that cannot be
fulfilled3 “1 could wish they might'' etc„ but they do not.-..
quibusdam optumis viris seems to be said with a little irony3

but the commentatore are divided on this question. —- 114, 1.

αἱ Ianum medium: This was one of the passages leading to the
forum, where the money· -changers had their booths. Compare

88 114, 5. The second part of the discussion of the utile, name·
ly, duobus propositis utilibus utrum utilius (1. 3, 10), 1s disposed

of ιιι a very summai-y manner.

114, 14. externorum: Instead of externa, scil. 7100 modo oom-
parantur, Cicero writes atvernorum, having m 'mind ommis, 1. 9,
and ipsa inter se emporia, as if- the full expression were extet-rmum
oomnwcza, and not commoda aterna. - vectigalia urbana, income
from real estate, factories, or mereantil'e speculations. So Atticus
(Nepos Att. 14⁹) Nulhe habuit hortos, nullam suburbanam aut

114, 17. pascere is to raise‘eattle. — 114, 18. Halo pascere·
This with quid quartum is wanting in most of the MSS. Itis
