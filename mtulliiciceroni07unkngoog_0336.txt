BOOK III. OHAP. IX. 5 38, 39. 307

ita videntur, beati. Cicero often speaks of the Epicureans as
wanting in acumen and scientific knowledge. Tusc. Disp. Ι. 21,

48 ο quo intellaeqi potest quam acuti natura sint, quoniam haee sine
doctrina credituri fuerunt‚· In Pis. 29, 70 non philosophia solum
sed etiam ceteris studiis, quae fere Epicureos aoqleqm dabunt, per—
politus ·‚· De Fin. ΙΙ. 25, 80 sed quamvis comis (Epicurus) iu amicis
tuendis suerit, tamem . . . non satis, acutus fuit.- 133, 31. ›ccm-
mentioiam, ‘⁶ fabricated,” opposed to moral truth, calculated to
convey a false impression.- 136, 82. id denotes the possession
of the ring, or the possibility of any one's committing a wrong
without the knowedge of some one, either-gods or mem—137,
1. defendat denotes not always defending something that is at-
tacked or criticised, but simply maintaining, asserting. De Orat.
H. c. 38 Carneades nullam umquam iu illis suis disputationibus
rem defendit, quam uon probarit ; uulhm oppuqmavit, quam uon
everterit ; and c. 50 Sed meritam ae debitam fuisso defenderes.

137, ὅ. Negant 111 fleri posse, ‘⁶ They say that this, is impossi-
ble,'’ i. e. that such a crime can ever escape the knowledge of
Gods and men.

137, 6. Nequaquam potest id quidem. The MSS. all have
Quamquam for Nequaquam, which· 1s an emendation of Manutius.
The change seems necessary for the train of thought3 otherwise
Cicero would admit* the possibility of this ignorance 'of the gods
in regard to human actions, which he always denies. De Nat.
Deor. Ι. 2, 33 De Leg. Ι. ¹7, 213 De Fin. Ι. 16, 51. Moreover, he
had denied it above, quasi . defendat ; and what follows sed
quaero seems to imply the same. Those who retain Quamquam
supply ueqari with potest ,⁰ or they fancy that Cicero speaks as
an Academic, and really means to imply that the Gods are igno-
rant of the affairs of men.

137, 8. rustice, “ obstinately, '’ like ἀγροίκως ·for ἀμαθῶς, ἀμού-
σως.- -137, 9. verbum refers to the exemplum just given. Plaut.
Trucul. IV. 4, 32 Verum est verbum, quod memoratur: ubi amici,
. 137, 11. tormenta, instrumente of tol-ture, ‘3‘tests '' he quali-
fies the very strong word by tamquam and quaedam.--187, 13.
expediat, ‘⁶ brings an advantage,'’ independently of the right or
wrong of the action. Cicero avoids using utile, because he al-
ways denies any difference between utile and honestum.
