De Orat. Π. 69, 280 eum &murm amnem-et Rutilium ambitm,cum
ipae nonnul oeaetfactus, illo repulsam tulisset, et in eim tabvdiae
ostenderet litteras A. 17'. P. R. idque diceret em, “ aetumfide P. Ru-
tili-i,·’' Rutilius autem, 44 ante factum, post relatum ;” Ο. Canius,
eques Manus, cum Rufo, adesset, mlamat neutrum illie litteris
docloerari. “ Quid erqo .⁹” inquit Scaurus ; “ Aemilius fecit, plec-
titur Rutilius.”—143‚ 25. hortulos means the whole estate.
The word is so used in the XII tablcs3 and it is called villa
below in ς 59. — 143, 27. interpellatoribus, 44 troublesome vis-
itors;⁷’ aine interp„ 44 without interruption.”
148, 28. qui argentariam (scil. rem) taceret, “who was in
, the banking business.‘ ‘’ It is not easy to see why the subjunc-
tive is used. Perhaps it is intended to describe Pythiu33 ‘being
a man in the banking business? and so quite capable of doing

that sort of thing3 perhaps it is suggested 1 v the indefinite qui· ,

dam and used without any arrii ο peruia—143, 29. venales
quidem: The force of quidem is given by emphasizing venalem
not for sale, but quite at the service of Canius

148, 32. promisissem. e. ad mnam aa venturum mest ‘had ac-
cepted the invitation? — qul ..esset .gratiosus describes Pyth-
ius as a very popular man from his calling (ut amentarius), which
brought him into contact with all classes.

144, 4. temporl,‘ ‘at the proper timess’ — 144, 5. pro so quis.
que is better taken with adferebam each one came for himself
(they all came), and Ιποιιὲῑπ. what he had taken. Heine takes
the words with asperat,- “what each one had been able to take
(pro auia viribus, pro aua poa-te) ho brought” S. Ambros. 111.
c. 11 unusquisque, quod ceperat, certatim offerebat epulantibus.

59 144, 10. hie aquati09‘ ‘'here is the water supplv ”for the city;
icti then refers to the inhabitants. S. Ambros. ibid. Responsum
quaerenti aquationem illic esse, duleis aquae qratia innumerabiles
eo pim convenire.

144, 12. gravate, scil. ιιρίι,4 ‘he makes objectionsff’

144, 14. insti-actast ‘furnishedst — 144, 15. nomina facit,
Pythius‘ ‘makes the entry m his books, and completes the trans-

action.” Gai. Inst. 111. 128 and 129 Ditterie obliqatio fit veluti
nominibus tranem-ipticiie. A re in personam Mamm-iptioflt, veluti
ai id, quod tu a emptionis causa aut conductionis aut societatis mihi
debeas, inda &expensum τῶι· tulero. The commentatore. are divided
as to the subject to be understood with facit, whether Pythius
