144, 16. scalmum nullum, ‘⁴ not even the thole-pin of a boat,”
no sign of a boat— 144, 17. nuni feriae quaedam . . . essent,

quently, a strong negative.

Cicero's colleague. According to the practice at that time the
formula was a statement of the case drawn up by the praetor
and handed to the iuda for-his guidancc in the trial of the case.
The sor-make de dolo malo were used in actions for damages 'on
the ground of fraud.—- 144, 28. in quihus ipsis etc„ “and when
he was asked what was (ἱ. e. what was the meaning of) dolus
malmin these formulae, he used to answer’ ’etc.

etc.; fraud in these matters was punished by the XII tables.
The guilty party was bound to restore double the amount em-
bezzled.—- 145, 8. loge Plaetoria: This law, passed before 3-0.
192, first established a difference between minors under twenty-
five years of age and older persons, Defrauding the former was
punished with severe fines and loss of civil rights; and to insure
greater protection a conti-act with a minor was only valid when
made in the presence of a curator appointed by the praetor. An
action could be brought, not only by the injured party, but by
any third person.— -sine lege iudiciis, in quibus additur: These
were the actiones bonae fidei, as distinguished from those stricti
iuris. In the latter the iudex was confined to the formula issued
by the praetor3 he could only render his decision in those pre-

cise terms. If the claim made was excessive in amount, or if

there was an error in the formula, the plaintiff lost his case. In
the other class of actions (bonae fidei), the arbiter was not bound
precisely to the somula ,⁰ he could take into consideration all
the circumstances and decide according to the equity (aequitas)
of the case. In §70 the cases of this sort are enumerated. An
allegation of fraud against the plaintiff, which in the actions
ebriati iuris must, in order to be taken into consideration, be
specially made by an &suffitio doli, was in the actiones bonae fidei
within the competence of the court from the very form of the
action. Cic. pro Rosc.§ 10 iudicium est pecuniae certae, afr-bimum
