errove sit nooeave solutus non ait.” do ,furtis in the text means,
therefore, “in regard to any thests the slave might have com··
mitted and for which he might still be liable to punishment.’'
The last part of the passage just quoted from Gellius is explained
by the following: Gai. IV. 75 ex maleficiis 'filiorum familias servo-
rumve, velut ei furtum fecerint aut iniuriam commiserint, uocales
actiones proditae sunt, αι liceret pam dominove aut litio aestima-
tionem sufferre aut nomae dedere.

not held to a knowledge of the defects of the slave.

'12 149, 9. intellegentiae is used here like sapientis on p. 145,19;
he means to censure wrong aetion under the color of prudence3
compare below, p. 158, 30 simulatione prudentiam—149, 4. ista

It was a common manoeuvre of will-forgers to join with their
own the names of some person or persons of influence and posi-
tion. Compare the connection of the Roscii with Chrysogonus
-in the attempt to get possession of the property of the elder
Roscius—149, 18. eum with auspicarentur has the meaning of
